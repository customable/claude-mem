## Key Insights

- **Task Deduplication Implemented**: Added SHA-256 hashing for task deduplication (Issue #207) with new `deduplication_key` field in Task entity and repository methods.
- **Database Configuration Refactored**: Consolidated migration configuration across SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL for consistency and automatic discovery.
- **Bug Fixes Applied**: Resolved SQL query logic in ObservationRepository and fixed migration path issues for TypeScript builds.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Implemented batch operations for session queries and added proper indexing to address N+1 query problems.
- **Multi-Database Support**: Confirmed MikroORM setup supports SQLite (default), PostgreSQL, and MySQL with 15 entities and growing migration history.
