## Key Insights

- **Entity Structure Review**: Detailed analysis of `Summary`, `Session`, and `Observation` entities reveals a robust data model for tracking Claude Code sessions, observations, and learning outcomes.
- **Modular Architecture**: The project uses a modular design with distributed `CLAUDE.md` files, SSE for real-time updates, and a task queue system for asynchronous processing.
- **SSE-Writer Issue**: Recurring "Directory mismatch" errors in SSE-Writer logs need resolution to ensure consistent file generation and real-time updates.
- **Task Queue System**: The task queue handles priority-based processing, but refinements may be needed for stability and error handling.
- **Next Steps**: Focus on fixing SSE-Writer directory mismatches and ensuring uniform `CLAUDE.md` file generation across modules.
