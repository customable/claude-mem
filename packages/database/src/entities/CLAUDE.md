## Key Insights

- Repository tracking fields (`repo_path`, `is_worktree`, `branch`) were added to the `Session` entity, enabling better context tracking for sessions.
- The `Observation` entity was enhanced with an indexed `repo_path` field to improve querying performance.
- Multiple sessions focused on analyzing entity structures (`Session`, `Observation`, `Document`, `Summary`), indicating a phase of architectural review.
- Recent summaries highlight successful MCP server migration to `McpServer`, dependency updates (Vite, Zod), and resolution of merge conflicts.
- Next steps include merging resolved PRs (e.g., #150, #170, #172) into `main` and verifying build stability.
