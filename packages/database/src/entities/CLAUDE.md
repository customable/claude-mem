## Key Insights

- Repository tracking fields (`repo_path`, `is_worktree`, `branch`) were added to the `Session` entity, enabling better context tracking for sessions.
- The `Observation` entity was enhanced with an indexed `repo_path` field to complement the existing `cwd` field, improving query performance.
- Multiple entity structures (`Session`, `Observation`, `Document`, `Summary`) were reviewed, indicating a focus on understanding the data model.
- Recent work involved migrating the MCP server to `McpServer`, resolving merge conflicts, and updating dependencies (Vite, Zod).
- Next steps include merging resolved PRs (e.g., #150, #170, #172) into main and verifying build stability.
