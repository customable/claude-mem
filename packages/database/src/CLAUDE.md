## Key Insights

- **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Extensive work resolving conflicts between `codeSnippets` and `learningInsights` features in MikroORM configuration, migrations, and repository exports.
- **Database Architecture**: Project uses MikroORM with SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL support, Unit of Work pattern for transactions, and modular repository structure.
- **Feature Integration**: Successfully merged parallel development branches (code snippets vs. learning insights dashboard) with proper TypeScript type safety.
- **Migration Management**: Conflicts in migration files (`CreateCodeSnippetsTable` vs `CreateInsightsTables`) were resolved while maintaining correct ordering.
- **Next Steps**: Testing required for integrated features, CSS warning in UI package needs attention, and remaining TypeScript errors in plugin-entry.ts.
