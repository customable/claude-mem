## Key Insights

- **Test Suite Expansion**: Comprehensive test suites were added for `TaskRepository`, `ObservationRepository`, and `SessionRepository`, covering CRUD operations, filtering, and business logic.
- **Task Priority System**: A new task priority system was implemented, with tests validating priority-based task handling and fallback capabilities.
- **Embedding Provider Refactoring**: The embedding provider system was refactored to support multiple providers (local, Mistral) using a registry pattern.
- **Type Safety Improvements**: Helper functions like `taskInput` were enhanced with generics to improve type safety across the monorepo.
- **Database Agnostic Design**: MikroORM entity relationships were analyzed for database-agnostic compatibility, with plans to implement missing relations.
