## Key Insights

- **Worker Federation Implementation**: Multiple migrations and exports were added to support worker federation (Issue #263), including token-based auth and a new `worker_federation` table.
- **Task Tracking Enhancements**: New `user_tasks` table migrations were introduced to track CLI task operations (Issue #260), with deduplication support via a `deduplication_key` column.
- **Plan Mode Tracking**: Added database schema changes to track plan mode state in sessions, including timestamps and counters.
- **Archived Outputs for Endless Mode**: Implemented `archived_outputs` table to store full tool outputs for later recall (Issue #109).
- **MikroORM Migration Patterns**: Discovered and followed MikroORM's migration structure, with a central index file exporting all migration classes.
