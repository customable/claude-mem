## Key Insights

- **Database Evolution**: The project uses MikroORM with 10+ migrations, showing rapid schema development including memory tiering, decision tracking, and importance scoring features.
- **Memory Tiering**: New fields (`memory_tier`, `access_count`, etc.) and SleepAgentService were added for memory consolidation across core/working/archive/ephemeral tiers.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Multiple merge conflicts in migration files were resolved, particularly around CreateInsightsTables and CreateCodeSnippetsTable migrations.
- **New Features**: Added support for Git worktree tracking, raw messages storage, code snippets with FTS, and learning insights dashboard tables.
- **Refactoring**: Migration index file was simplified by removing redundant `mikroOrmMigrations` array exports while maintaining individual migration exports.
