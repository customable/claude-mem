## Key Insights

- **Database Expansion**: Two new tables (`user_tasks` and `archived_outputs`) were added to track CLI task operations and store full tool outputs for Endless Mode.
- **Deduplication**: Task deduplication functionality was implemented via a `deduplication_key` column in the tasks table.
- **Migration System**: Mikro-ORM migrations are managed through a central index file, ensuring organized schema updates.
- **Real-Time Progress**: WebSocket and SSE communication patterns were extended for multi-client support (browser, worker, SSE-writer).
- **Next Steps**: Complete SSE-Writer migration to WebSocket, test unified real-time events, and resolve remaining type dependencies.
