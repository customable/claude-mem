## Key Insights

- **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Multiple merge conflicts were resolved in `unit-of-work.ts`, `MikroOrmUnitOfWork` constructor, and repository exports, indicating parallel development of features (code snippets vs. learning insights).
- **New Features Added**: Three new repositories (`DailyStats`, `TechnologyUsage`, `Achievement`) were implemented, expanding the database layer for analytics and tracking.
- **MikroORM Integration**: The project uses MikroORM for database operations with a Unit of Work pattern for transaction management.
- **Migration Conflicts**: Conflicts in migration files (`CreateCodeSnippetsTable` vs. `CreateInsightsTables`) were resolved, ensuring schema consistency.
- **TypeScript Safety**: Focus on maintaining TypeScript type safety during merges and feature integration.
