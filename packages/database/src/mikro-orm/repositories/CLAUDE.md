| #69 | 11:34 AM | 🔴 | Fixed SQL query logic for file filtering | ~5791 |
| #66 | 11:33 AM | 🔵 | ObservationRepository uses MikroORM with FTS5 | ~5522 |
| #64 | 11:32 AM | 🔵 | Batch delete with chunking in ObservationRepo | ~1969 |

## Key Insights

- **Performance Optimizations**: Added batch queries and indexes to resolve N+1 query issues in session listing (closed #201, #202).
- **Database Architecture**: Uses MikroORM with SQLite FTS5 for full-text search and batch operations (e.g., chunked deletes for SQLite IN clause limits).
- **Bug Fixes**: Corrected SQL query logic for file filtering in `ObservationRepository`.
- **Next Steps**: Monitor performance post-optimization, apply migrations, and verify fixes in production.
- **Feature Gaps**: Identified issues with snippet saving, auto-spawning, and documentation accuracy (created GitHub issues #257 and related).
