## Key Insights

- **Major UI Overhaul**: The project underwent significant UI changes, including a responsive sidebar navigation system replacing the previous tab-based layout, with mobile-first design principles.
- **Task Management System**: A comprehensive task management system was implemented, including new API endpoints, interfaces, and a TasksView component with both Kanban and list view modes.
- **Real-time Communication**: Enhanced real-time capabilities through WebSocket hook implementation and SSE (Server-Sent Events) for dashboard updates and live activity streams.
- **Worker Management**: Added modal-based worker spawning functionality, improving the user experience for worker management operations.
- **Architectural Decisions**: The system uses a decoupled worker capabilities architecture with abstract capabilities and provider implementations, suggesting a flexible and extensible design pattern.
