## Key Insights

- **UI Architecture**: The project uses React with Vite, TypeScript, and DaisyUI. Key components include `ProjectsView`, `SessionsView`, and `ObservationDetails`, which are shared across multiple views.
- **Real-Time Features**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) are heavily used for real-time updates (e.g., `useSSE` hook in `StatusBar` and `Dashboard`).
- **File Tracking**: The UI tracks file operations (`files_read`, `files_modified`) in components like `ProjectsView` and `ObservationDetails`.
- **API Client**: The API client supports session/observation management, including new GDPR-compliant deletion methods (`deleteObservation`, `bulkDeleteObservations`).
- **Bug Fix**: Event propagation in `ObservationDetails` tabs was fixed to prevent unintended parent behaviors.
- **Code Quality**: No commented imports or technical debt markers (TODO/FIXME) were found, suggesting a clean codebase.
