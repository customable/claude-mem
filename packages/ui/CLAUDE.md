## Key Insights

- **Metadata Handling**: New `MetadataDisplay` component improves document metadata visualization, replacing raw JSON display in `DocumentCard`.
- **File Tracking**: Enhanced `Session` interface with `files_read` and `files_modified` arrays, now visible in the UI via `SessionCard`.
- **Insights Dashboard**: Comprehensive analytics feature added with heatmaps, technology usage tracking, and achievements display.
- **Code Snippets**: API endpoints for code snippet management (retrieval, search, deletion) were integrated into the client.
- **Refactoring**: Cleanup of unused imports and state variables in `Insights.tsx` and related components.
