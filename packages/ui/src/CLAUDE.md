## Key Insights

- **Task Management System**: A comprehensive task management system was implemented with new API endpoints (`getTasks`, `getTask`, `getTaskCounts`), interfaces (`Task`, `TaskStatus`, `TaskType`), and a dedicated TasksView component with Kanban and list views.
- **UI Enhancements**: The navigation system was refactored to use a responsive sidebar layout, replacing the previous tab-based system. This includes a new Sidebar component, responsive CSS, and mobile-friendly behavior.
- **Worker Spawning**: The worker spawning functionality was enhanced with a new modal interface (`SpawnWorkerModal`) that allows users to configure providers (Mistral, Gemini, OpenRouter, etc.) before spawning workers.
- **Real-time Updates**: The system leverages Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates, as seen in the `useSSE` hook and components like `LiveView` and `Dashboard`.
- **Architecture**: The project uses a hybrid SSE/WebSocket architecture with a hub-and-spoke worker model, MikroORM for database operations, and Vitest for testing. Future plans include worker federation and database migration options.
