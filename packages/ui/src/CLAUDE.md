## Key Insights

- **Endless Mode Implementation**: Significant progress on Endless Mode feature with new API endpoints, UI components, and compression tracking types added to the Dashboard.
- **SSE Integration**: DashboardView uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates, combining with periodic polling for robust data streaming.
- **Settings Architecture**: Comprehensive settings system implemented with multiple tabs (General, Processing, Advanced, Worker) and validation logic.
- **Achievement System**: Discovery of achievement tracking in Insights view with progress states and API integration.
- **Performance Focus**: Previous analysis showed 94.5% token compression efficiency and identified SQLite lock contention issues needing resolution.
