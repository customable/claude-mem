## Key Insights

- **Analytics & Insights Expansion**: Major focus on analytics (existing) and new Insights dashboard with comprehensive metrics (summary, activity, heatmaps, achievements). Both features now have dedicated UI components and API endpoints.
- **Code Snippets Integration**: New code snippet management system added with API endpoints, UI component (with syntax highlighting), and integration into observation details.
- **Refactoring Efforts**: Cleanup of unused code (imports, state variables) in Insights components, improving maintainability.
- **UI Architecture**: Project uses hash-based routing with 9 main views (Analytics, Projects, Sessions, etc.) and a modular component structure.
- **API Client Growth**: Significant expansion of API client with new endpoints for insights, code snippets, and enhanced analytics capabilities.
