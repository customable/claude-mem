## Key Insights

- **Endless Mode Implementation**: Added comprehensive Endless Mode functionality including dashboard stats widget, API endpoints for archived outputs, and settings UI. This feature reduces token usage by ~95% using dual-memory compression.
- **Settings Refactoring**: Successfully modularized the monolithic Settings.tsx (2061 lines) into 17 focused components (GeneralSettings, ProviderSettings, ContextSettings, etc.) with improved validation and confirmation flows.
- **Dashboard Enhancements**: Integrated real-time SSE updates and added EndlessModeCard for compression statistics display. The dashboard now shows token savings, compression progress, and detailed metrics.
- **API Expansion**: Added 5 new API endpoints for archived output management (getArchivedOutputs, searchArchivedOutputs, etc.) to support Endless Mode's compression tracking.
- **Next Steps**: Address build warnings for CSS/chunk sizes, optimize synchronous Endless Mode implementation, and continue Phase 5 optimizations as outlined in the feature proposal.
