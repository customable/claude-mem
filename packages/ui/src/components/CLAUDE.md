| #11872 | 10:38 PM | 🔵 | StatusBar uses SSE for health monitoring | ~1367 |

## Key Insights

- **SSE Integration**: StatusBar component uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) via `useSSE` hook for real-time system health monitoring.
- **Modular Documentation**: Project uses distributed `CLAUDE.md` files for component-specific documentation.
- **Task Queue System**: Robust task queue with priority handling, but requires stability improvements.
- **Directory Mismatch**: Recurring "Directory mismatch" errors in SSE-Writer logs need resolution.
- **Core Components**: Key modules include Dashboard, Session Service, Task Service, and worker implementations.
