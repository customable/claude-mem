## Key Insights

- **Worker Management Enhancements**: Major UI improvements to worker spawning via modal (SpawnWorkerModal) with provider configuration options (Mistral, Gemini, OpenRouter, etc.). Replaced direct spawn calls with modal-based workflow.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: New responsive Sidebar component created with "Tasks" navigation item added, improving UI structure and mobile responsiveness.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: StatusBar and WorkerStatus components leverage SSE for real-time system health and worker status updates.
- **Bun to Node Migration**: Ongoing effort to replace Bun runtime references with Node-compatible alternatives across documentation, build scripts, and Docker configurations.
- **Testing Improvements**: Expanded test coverage for middleware, XML parsing, and retry utilities, with Vitest configured for sequential execution to prevent RAM issues.
