## Key Insights

- **API Client Expansion**: Significant work on extending the API client with new endpoints for Endless Mode (archived outputs), project settings, and task management (retry functionality).
- **Endless Mode Support**: Added compression tracking types and archived output management, indicating progress on Issue #109.
- **Task Management**: Enhanced task handling with retry capabilities (Issue #285) and improved task listing with count information.
- **Project Settings**: New CRUD operations for project settings, completing the API client's resource management capabilities.
- **Discovery Focus**: Multiple observations about existing API structures, revealing comprehensive data models for workers, documents, insights, and analytics.
- **Missing Functionality**: Noted absence of project modification endpoints (delete/archive/rename), suggesting potential gaps in current implementation.
- **Performance Considerations**: Worker processes consume ~138MB each, with 5114 tasks (mostly completed) in the database.
- **Next Steps**: Multi-database support (SQLite + PostgreSQL) and addressing JavaScript bundle performance issues are prioritized.
