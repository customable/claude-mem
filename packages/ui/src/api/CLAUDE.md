## Key Insights

- **Endless Mode Development**: Significant progress on Endless Mode, including new API endpoints for archived outputs and compression tracking types. This aligns with the goal of reducing token usage by ~95%.
- **API Client Expansion**: Multiple new API endpoints and interfaces added (e.g., project settings, task management, retry functionality), enhancing backend communication capabilities.
- **Refactoring Efforts**: Large-scale modularization of `Settings.tsx` (17 files) and updates to observation interfaces to sync with system prompts.
- **Missing Functionality**: Some project management endpoints (e.g., delete, archive) are absent, indicating potential gaps in the current implementation.
- **Build Optimization Needed**: Warnings about CSS and chunk sizes suggest performance improvements are required for the UI.
