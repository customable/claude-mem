## Key Insights

- **Task Management Expansion**: The API client now supports comprehensive task management with new endpoints (`getTasks`, `getTask`, `getTaskCounts`) and interfaces (`Task`, `TaskStatus`, `TaskType`), indicating a shift toward structured task workflows.
- **Worker Federation Progress**: Provider configuration was added to `spawnWorker` and `SpawnStatus`, aligning with Issue #254 and enabling multi-provider worker spawning (e.g., Docker, NPM).
- **Auto-Spawn Capabilities**: New fields (`autoSpawnEnabled`, `autoSpawnCount`, `autoSpawnProviders`) in `SpawnStatus` suggest automated worker scaling is being implemented.
- **API Client Maturity**: The client now supports CRUD operations for documents, code snippets, search (semantic/regular), and analytics, reflecting a robust backend integration layer.
- **Architecture Documentation**: Recent sessions highlight a hybrid SSE/WebSocket system, worker hub federation proposals, and CLI-driven task constraints, guiding next steps for scalability and real-time features.
