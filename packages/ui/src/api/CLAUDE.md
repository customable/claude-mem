## Key Insights

- **API Client Expansion**: Significant enhancements to the API client, including new task management endpoints (`getTasks`, `getTask`, `getTaskCounts`) and interfaces (`Task`, `TaskStatus`, `TaskType`). This suggests a focus on improving task handling capabilities.
- **Worker Management**: Added provider configuration support to `spawnWorker` and `SpawnStatus` interface, addressing Issue #254. This enhances flexibility in worker spawning and management.
- **Bun Replacement**: Multiple issues created to replace Bun with Node-compatible alternatives across documentation, build scripts, Docker configurations, and plugin hooks. This indicates a strategic shift away from Bun due to compatibility concerns.
- **Testing Improvements**: Comprehensive test suites added for error handling middleware, XML parser utilities, and retry utilities. Vitest configuration modified to run tests sequentially to prevent RAM issues, showing a focus on stability and reliability.
- **Modular Architecture**: Discovery of key interfaces (`SpawnStatus`, `InsightsSummary`) and API endpoints reveals a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns for worker management, analytics, and document handling.
