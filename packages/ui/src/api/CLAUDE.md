## Key Insights

- **API Client Expansion**: Significant enhancements to the API client, including new task management endpoints (`getTasks`, `getTask`, `getTaskCounts`) and interfaces (`Task`, `TaskCounts`). This suggests a focus on improving task handling and monitoring capabilities.
- **Worker Management**: Multiple discoveries and features related to worker spawning and management, including provider configuration support and auto-spawn functionality. This indicates ongoing work to make worker management more flexible and automated.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Recent sessions highlight extensive test coverage (416 tests across 18 files) and CI/CD improvements, emphasizing a strong focus on reliability and maintainability.
- **Runtime Migration**: The project is transitioning from Bun to Node.js for broader compatibility, with files already identified for migration. This is a critical architectural shift.
- **UI and UX Focus**: Multiple UI improvement issues were created, targeting dashboard, search, and analytics features, indicating a push to enhance user experience.
