## Key Insights

- **Worker Management**: Added auto-spawn capabilities to `SpawnStatus` interface (autoSpawnEnabled, autoSpawnCount, autoSpawnProviders)
- **API Discovery**: Found critical interfaces (`SpawnStatus`, `InsightsSummary`) and endpoints (`/workers/spawn-status`) for worker management
- **Performance Fixes**: Resolved N+1 query issues, optimized session queries, and added database indexes
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed code snippet extraction by normalizing escaped newlines and implemented task deduplication with SHA-256 hashing
- **Next Steps**: Test deduplication under load, verify production deployment, and monitor database performance improvements
