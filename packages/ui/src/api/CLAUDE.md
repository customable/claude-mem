## Key Insights

- **API Client Expansion**: Significant enhancements to the API client, including new task management endpoints (`getTasks`, `getTask`, `getTaskCounts`) and interfaces (`Task`, `TaskCounts`). This suggests a focus on improving task handling capabilities.
- **Worker Management**: Multiple discoveries and features related to worker spawning and management, including provider configurations and auto-spawn fields. This indicates ongoing work to enhance worker functionality and flexibility.
- **Bun to Node.js Migration**: Recent sessions highlight a strategic shift from Bun to Node.js due to compatibility issues. Key areas affected include build scripts, Docker configurations, and plugin hooks.
- **Testing Improvements**: Comprehensive test suites were added for error handling, XML parsing, and retry utilities, with adjustments to Vitest configuration to prevent RAM issues. This reflects a commitment to improving code reliability and test coverage.
- **Modular Architecture**: The project's architecture is modular, with clear separation of concerns in the API client (e.g., documents, code snippets, insights, search, and analytics). This design facilitates maintainability and scalability.
