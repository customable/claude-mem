## Key Insights

- **Worker Management**: The system has worker spawning capabilities with a `SpawnStatus` interface tracking availability, counts, and capacity. Auto-spawn fields were added to extend functionality.
- **Architecture Gaps**: Missing UI for task/plan management, incomplete task tracking, and undocumented auto-spawning behavior were identified as key gaps.
- **Recent Fixes**: Task deduplication (SHA-256 hashing), code snippet extraction (newline normalization), and session query optimization (N+1 resolution) were implemented.
- **Testing Needed**: Verify deduplication under load, test code snippet extraction in production, and monitor database performance improvements.
- **Next Steps**: Implement worker configuration modal, refactor metrics, and enhance task/plan management features.
