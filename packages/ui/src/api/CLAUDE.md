## Key Insights

- **API Client Expansion**: Significant enhancements to the API client, including new endpoints for project settings, task management, and worker spawning. The client now supports full CRUD operations.
- **Task Management**: Added `retryTask` functionality and improved task retrieval methods, addressing Issue #285.
- **Provider Configuration**: Extended worker spawning capabilities with provider-specific configurations, enhancing flexibility.
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: New interfaces for `ProjectSettings`, `Task`, and `SpawnStatus` improve type safety and data structure clarity.
- **Missing Endpoints**: No project modification endpoints (delete, archive, rename) were found, suggesting a gap in functionality or alternative implementation.
