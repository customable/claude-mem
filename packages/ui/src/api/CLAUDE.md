## Key Insights

- **Task Management Enhancements**: Added `retryTask` API endpoint and enhanced task listing capabilities (Issue #285). The API client now supports task filtering, single task retrieval, and status statistics.
- **Worker Management**: Extended `SpawnStatus` interface with provider configuration fields (Issue #254) and auto-spawn capabilities. The `spawnWorker` function now supports provider-specific configurations.
- **API Client Expansion**: Discovered and documented extensive API client methods for tasks, workers, documents, and analytics. The client now includes comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for task management.
- **UI Improvements**: Completed multiple UI enhancements including worker termination dialogs, task pagination, and settings validation. Addressed issues like achievement progress bar bugs and race conditions with SSE-Writer during Git operations.
- **Modularization Plans**: Identified the need for UI modularization (Issue #290) to address monolithic file structures and improve maintainability.
