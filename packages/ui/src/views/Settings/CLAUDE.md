## Key Insights

- **Settings UI Overhaul**: Major progress on Settings view with multiple new components (WorkerSettings, ProviderSettings, ContextSettings) and infrastructure (Types Interface, Constants File).
- **Reusable Components**: Created foundational UI components (FormField, ApiKeyInput) following clean export patterns for maintainability.
- **Configuration Expansion**: Added comprehensive configuration options for workers, AI providers, and context management.
- **Type System Updates**: Recent work expanded observation interfaces with new fields (concept, gitBranch, decisionCategory) and fixed type inconsistencies.
- **Critical Issues Identified**: Race condition in SSE-Writer during Git operations and missing observation types in OBSERVATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT need immediate attention.
