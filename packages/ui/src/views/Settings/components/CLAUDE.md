| ID | Time | T | Title | Read |
|----|------|---|-------|------|
| #2003 | 5:01 PM | 🟠 | Created ApiKeyInput component | ~1422 |
| #2002 | 5:01 PM | 🟠 | Created Settings components index | ~851 |
| #2001 | 5:01 PM | 🟠 | Created FormField component | ~1289 |

## Key Insights

- **UI Component Progress**: Three new reusable components (`ApiKeyInput`, `FormField`, and component index) were created for the Settings view, improving modularity and reusability.
- **Type System Updates**: Added new fields (`concept`, `gitBranch`, `decisionCategory`) to observation interfaces and expanded observation types, resolving type inconsistencies.
- **Bug Discovery**: Identified a critical bug where `OBSERVATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT` is missing 9 observation types, requiring immediate synchronization.
- **Race Condition**: Found a race condition where SSE-Writer overwrites `CLAUDE.md` during Git operations, needing a pause mechanism during such operations.
- **Next Steps**: Focus on fixing the observation prompt synchronization, implementing SSE-Writer pause logic, and continuing UI modularization as per issue #290.
