## Key Insights

- **UI Expansion**: Three major settings components (WorkerSettings, ProviderSettings, ContextSettings) were implemented, significantly expanding the configuration UI capabilities.
- **Configuration Focus**: New components handle worker management, AI provider configurations (including API keys), and context injection settings.
- **Type System Updates**: Recent work addressed observation type inconsistencies and expanded interfaces with new fields (concept, gitBranch, decisionCategory).
- **Technical Debt Identified**: Discovered issues with missing observation types in OBSERVATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT and race conditions in SSE-Writer during Git operations.
- **Next Priorities**: Fix prompt synchronization, implement SSE-Writer pausing during Git operations, and begin UI component modularization (per issue #290).
