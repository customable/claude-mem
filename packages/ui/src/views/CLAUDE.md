## Key Insights

- **Real-time Architecture**: The system heavily relies on Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates across multiple components (Dashboard, LiveView, MemoriesView).
- **Worker Management**: Worker connections and capabilities are central to the architecture, with references in Dashboard, Settings, and Live views.
- **Task System**: A new Tasks View component was created with Kanban and list views, indicating a focus on task management and monitoring.
- **Federation Proposal**: Recent sessions propose a WorkerHub Federation architecture for distributed worker pools with priority-based routing.
- **Database Evaluation**: Research into alternative database technologies is underway for potential migration.
