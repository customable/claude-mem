## Key Insights

- **SSE Implementation**: Multiple components (DashboardView, Live.tsx) use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates, indicating a strong focus on live data streaming.
- **Worker Integration**: Worker-related code is present in Dashboard, Settings, and Live views, suggesting backend worker processes are managed or monitored via the UI.
- **Task Deduplication**: Recent changes include SHA-256-based task deduplication to prevent duplicate processing, addressing potential efficiency issues.
- **Performance Fixes**: Resolved N+1 query problems and added database indexes to optimize session queries and overall performance.
- **Code Extraction Fix**: Fixed code snippet extraction by normalizing escaped newlines, ensuring proper handling of API outputs.
