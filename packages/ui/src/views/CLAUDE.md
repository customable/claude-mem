## Key Insights

- **Real-time Architecture**: The project heavily uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates across multiple components (Dashboard, LiveView, MemoriesView).
- **Task Management**: New Tasks View component provides monitoring for backend task queue with Kanban and list views.
- **Worker System**: Evidence of worker connections and management across Dashboard, Settings, and Live views suggests a distributed worker architecture.
- **UI Patterns**: Consistent use of React hooks (useState, useEffect, useSSE) and custom hooks for data management.
- **Next Steps**: Focus on implementing worker federation, evaluating database migration options, and completing package distribution system.
