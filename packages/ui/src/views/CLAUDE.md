## Key Insights

- **Real-time architecture**: Live View uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) via `/api/stream/events` for real-time updates
- **Worker integration**: Dashboard and other UI components reference worker connections, suggesting backend process management
- **Settings complexity**: Settings.tsx implements comprehensive tabbed navigation with React hooks for state management
- **Recent fixes**: Completed task deduplication (SHA-256 hashing), fixed code snippet extraction (newline normalization), and optimized session queries
- **Next steps**: Test deduplication under load, verify production snippet extraction, and monitor database performance improvements
