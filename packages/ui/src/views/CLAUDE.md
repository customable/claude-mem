## Key Insights

- **Analytics Enhancements**: Major improvements to the Analytics view including comparison mode, chart type toggles, and fullscreen functionality. The UI now supports dynamic data visualization with line/bar chart switching and mock comparison data generation.
- **Project Management**: Added comprehensive project actions (rename, archive, delete) with proper state management. Project deletion preserves observations and sessions while removing only project settings.
- **UI Component Structure**: Discovered and documented key UI components (Projects.tsx, Analytics.tsx) with their respective functionalities including session details, observation types, and file statistics.
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved tooltip callback issues in charts and simplified comparison mode to be UI-only, removing unnecessary API calls.
- **Future Work**: Identified opportunities for modularization of large UI components (e.g., Settings.tsx) and need to address race conditions in SSE-Writer during Git operations.
