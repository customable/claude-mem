## Key Insights

- ProjectsView and SessionsView are core UI components handling project/session data with React hooks
- File tracking uses `filesRead`/`filesModified` arrays in ProjectsView but not in Sessions.tsx
- Recent work focused on GDPR compliance, Windows terminal fixes, and MCP tool enhancements
- Pending tasks include addressing memory leaks (Issue #101) and Docker documentation
- Cross-project search was closed (Issue #6) but may need revisiting for future enhancements
