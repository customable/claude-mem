| #11874 | 10:38 PM | 🔵 | SSE Hook Implementation Analysis | ~2779 |

## Key Insights

- **SSE Integration**: The project uses a global EventSource connection via `useSSE` hook for real-time updates, managing worker states and task assignments with a singleton pattern.
- **Modular Architecture**: Key components include worker services, session management, and observation processing, with distributed `CLAUDE.md` files for documentation.
- **Critical Issues**: Persistent "Directory mismatch" errors in SSE-Writer logs need resolution to ensure stable real-time updates.
- **Task Queue System**: Features priority handling and event-driven processing, requiring refinement for improved stability.
- **Next Steps**: Address SSE-Writer errors and standardize `CLAUDE.md` generation across directories.
