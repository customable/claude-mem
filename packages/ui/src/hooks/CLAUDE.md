## Key Insights

- **Architecture Documentation**: Comprehensive analysis of the hybrid SSE/WebSocket architecture, including TaskDispatcher, WorkerHub, and SSEBroadcaster components.
- **Worker Federation Proposal**: Proposed a federated worker hub system (Issue #263) with priority-based routing to enhance scalability and task distribution.
- **Database Migration**: Identified challenges with SQLite and evaluated PostgreSQL as a potential alternative for production deployment.
- **Unified WebSocket System**: Proposed consolidating SSE and WebSocket communications (Issue #264) for improved real-time updates and worker management.
- **CLI-Driven Constraints**: The CLI-driven design enforces read-only UI constraints, requiring careful integration of task/plan monitoring features.
