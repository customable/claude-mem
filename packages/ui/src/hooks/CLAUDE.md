## Key Insights

- **Task Queue Enhancements**: Added `globalQueueStatus` to track pending/processing/failed tasks, with fixes for event handlers to maintain accurate counts.
- **Real-Time Features**: Implemented WebSocket hook with reconnection logic and SSE enhancements for task/worker status tracking.
- **Bun Deprecation**: Identified deep Bun integration causing compatibility issues; planned migration to Node.js across docs, Docker, and build scripts.
- **Testing Improvements**: Expanded test coverage for middleware/XML/retry utilities, with sequential Vitest execution to avoid RAM issues.
- **Next Steps**: Prioritize Bun removal (especially plugin hooks), expand E2E testing, and ensure Node.js compatibility.
