## Key Insights

- **Archived Outputs Feature**: The project is actively implementing archived outputs functionality tied to "Endless Mode" (Issue #109), with new API endpoints and DataRouter integration.
- **Insights & Achievements**: The insights service tracks user activity metrics and implements achievement unlocking logic based on thresholds for observations, decisions, bugfixes, etc.
- **API Structure**: The backend organizes routes into four main groups (SSE, Data, Search, Export) with dedicated routers and rate limiting configurations.
- **Search Implementation**: Semantic search uses a polling mechanism through the task service, while vector/Qdrant synchronization functionality appears to be missing or uses different naming.
- **Error Handling**: Recent refactoring standardized error responses in archived outputs endpoints to use direct Express response methods.
