## Key Insights

- **SSE Integration**: HooksRouter now includes SSE broadcasting capabilities for real-time event notifications, with new writer pause/resume endpoints to prevent Git conflicts.
- **Testing Expansion**: Comprehensive test suites added for SearchRouter, DataRouter, and TaskService, improving code reliability.
- **Architecture Discovery**: Detailed analysis of backend services including SSE broadcasting, task dispatching, and API routing structures.
- **Race Condition Mitigation**: New endpoints and broadcast methods added to handle writer pausing during Git operations, addressing identified race conditions.
- **UI Refactoring Needed**: Large UI components (e.g., Settings.tsx) identified as needing modularization for better maintainability.
