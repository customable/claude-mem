## Key Insights

- **Migration System Created**: New modules for legacy data migration (type mapper, SQLite backup, migration tools) address Issue #198.
- **WebSocket & SSE Architecture**: Backend uses WorkerHub for WebSocket worker management and SSEBroadcaster for real-time event streaming.
- **Modular Router Design**: Backend routes are organized into 20 specialized router classes with shared utilities via BaseRouter.
- **Multi-Tenancy Planning**: Column-based strategy recommended for MVP, with PostgreSQL for long-term scalability (SQLite has distribution issues).
- **Rebranding Initiative**: Project is transitioning to "remembr" with domain acquisition and package renaming planned.
