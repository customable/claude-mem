## Key Insights

- **Archived Outputs Feature**: Significant progress on implementing archived outputs functionality for "Endless Mode" (Issue #109), including new API endpoints and DataRouter integration.
- **Insights Service**: Discovered achievement tracking and daily stats logic in insights-service.ts, including bugfix tracking and first-time event detection.
- **Search Functionality**: Semantic search uses polling mechanism with 30-second timeout; no Qdrant sync or vector search found in current implementation.
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses across archived outputs endpoints using Express response methods.
- **API Structure**: Backend routes organized into SSE, Data, Search, and Export groups with dependency injection pattern.
