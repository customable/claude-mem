## Key Insights

- **SSE Integration**: Multiple changes focused on integrating SSE (Server-Sent Events) into the hooks system, including new event types (`writer:pause`, `writer:resume`) and broadcaster methods. This enables real-time updates during git operations.
- **Archiving & Compression**: Discovery of Endless Mode archiving logic and compression task handling suggests a focus on optimizing output storage and retrieval.
- **TypeScript & Code Quality**: Addition of a `typecheck` script and modularization efforts (e.g., refactoring `Settings.tsx`) indicate ongoing improvements to maintainability and type safety.
- **API & Hooks Expansion**: New endpoints for writer control (pause/resume) and subagent lifecycle management expand the backend's capabilities for real-time collaboration.
- **Project Lifecycle Management**: Found functionality for project deletion/archiving/renaming, indicating robust project management features in the data routes.
