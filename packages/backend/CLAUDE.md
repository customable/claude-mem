## Key Insights

- **Archived Outputs Feature**: The project is actively implementing archived outputs functionality tied to "Endless Mode" (Issue #109), with new API endpoints, DataRouter integration, and standardized error handling.
- **Backend Architecture**: The backend uses a modular router architecture with specialized routers (Health, Data, Workers, etc.) and a BaseRouter class providing common utilities.
- **Semantic Search**: The system implements semantic search through a polling mechanism in the task service, but lacks vector database or Qdrant synchronization functionality.
- **Missing Features**: Several components are missing or incomplete, including UI implementation for achievements, API endpoints for archived outputs stats, and emoji mappings in system prompts.
- **Next Steps**: Focus on implementing missing API endpoints, fixing achievement progress calculation, and addressing incomplete emoji mappings.
