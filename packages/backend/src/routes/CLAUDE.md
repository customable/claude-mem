## Key Insights

- **Caching Implementation**: Major focus on adding LRU caching with TTL support across multiple endpoints (projects, analytics, stats) to improve performance and reduce database load.
- **Cache Invalidation**: Systematic addition of cache invalidation logic after CRUD operations (create, delete, bulk delete) to ensure data consistency, particularly important for GDPR compliance.
- **Batch Operations**: Refactored observation deletion to use batch operations instead of individual deletes, improving efficiency.
- **Type Safety**: Several refactoring changes to improve TypeScript type safety, including explicit type annotations and fixing type errors in worker metadata access.
- **Health & Metrics**: Added cache management endpoints to HealthRouter and integrated MetricsRouter for better observability and system monitoring.
