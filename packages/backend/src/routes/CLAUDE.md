## Key Insights

- **Archived Outputs Feature**: Significant progress on implementing archived outputs API endpoints for "Endless Mode" (Issue #109), including standardization of error handling and integration with DataRouter.
- **Backend Architecture**: Discovered a well-organized modular router architecture with 20+ specialized routers, including a BaseRouter class providing common utilities.
- **SSE Integration**: Added SSEBroadcaster dependency to HooksRouter for real-time updates, with new writer pause/resume endpoints for git operations.
- **Project Management**: Found existing project deletion/archive/rename functionality in data routes, with extensive use of 'project' parameter across endpoints.
- **Refactoring**: Completed major refactoring of Settings.tsx (2061 lines) into 17 modular files and addressed inconsistencies in system prompts.
