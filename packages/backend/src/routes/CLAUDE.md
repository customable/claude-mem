## Key Insights

- **SSE Implementation**: Multiple discoveries around Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation, including StreamRouter class and SSEBroadcaster dependency additions.
- **Archived Outputs**: New API endpoints for archived outputs functionality tied to "Endless Mode" (Issue #109), with standardized error handling.
- **Backend Structure**: Well-organized modular router architecture with 20+ specialized routers and consistent BaseRouter utilities.
- **Project Management**: Extensive use of project parameters across data routes and project lifecycle management endpoints.
- **Real-time Features**: Writer pause/resume endpoints added for git operations, suggesting enhanced real-time control capabilities.

## Next Steps
- Implement and test new archived outputs functionality
- Explore integration of SSE features with existing endpoints
- Address any remaining API authentication issues
- Consider performance optimizations for the modular router architecture
