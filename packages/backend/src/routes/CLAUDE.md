## Key Insights

- **Semantic Search Progress**: Qdrant integration for semantic search is partially implemented with fallback to text search, enhanced with status reporting and minScore filtering.
- **Session Management**: Added CAPSLOCK/urgent detection, pre-compact hooks for context preservation, and improved session enrichment with file tracking.
- **System Maintenance**: New CleanupRouter addresses process/memory leaks (Issue #101) with stats and manual trigger endpoints.
- **API Enhancements**: Search responses now include vector DB status, and session endpoints provide better file tracking visibility.
- **Architecture**: Backend follows modular router pattern with 19 specialized routers, using dependency injection for service integration.
