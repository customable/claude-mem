## Key Insights

- **Memory Tiering System**: Implemented comprehensive memory tiering with Sleep Agent service, new database fields, and API endpoints for consolidation and tier management.
- **Observation Management**: Added pinning and importance features with five new API endpoints for enhanced observation organization.
- **Performance Optimization**: Refactored analytics timeline to use SQL aggregation, significantly improving performance by reducing memory processing.
- **Router Architecture**: Discovered and expanded modular router system with new routers (SleepAgent, Decisions, Insights) following established patterns.
- **Data Handling**: Increased fetch limits (10,000→100,000) and added code snippet management endpoints, expanding backend capabilities.
