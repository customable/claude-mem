## Key Insights

- **Analytics Optimization**: Refactored `getAnalyticsTimeline` to use SQL aggregation, improving performance by offloading processing to the database.
- **Data Fetch Limits**: Increased API fetch limits from 10,000 to 100,000 records to support larger datasets.
- **Insights Dashboard**: Added a new `InsightsRouter` for learning analytics, including summary stats, activity tracking, and heatmap visualizations.
- **Code Snippets**: Expanded API with CRUD endpoints for code snippet management, integrating `ICodeSnippetRepository`.
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved issues with empty/null project names in analytics and fixed a duplicate `observation_id` bug in `CodeSnippet` entity.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Identified gaps in SSE integration for insights; next steps include implementing real-time broadcasting.
