## Key Insights

- **Archived Outputs Feature Development**: Significant progress on implementing archived outputs functionality for "Endless Mode" (Issue #109), including new API endpoints (list, search, stats, get by ID/observation ID) and standardized error handling.
- **SSE & Writer Control**: Added Server-Sent Events (SSE) broadcasting capabilities and writer pause/resume endpoints for git operations, enhancing real-time functionality.
- **Backend Architecture**: Discovered well-organized modular router architecture with 20+ specialized routers and consistent error handling patterns.
- **Missing Components**: Identified gaps including missing API endpoints for archived outputs stats and incomplete emoji mappings in system prompts.
- **Next Steps**: Focus on implementing missing API endpoints, addressing emoji mapping inconsistencies, and completing achievement system UI improvements.
