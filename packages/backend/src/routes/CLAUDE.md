## Key Insights

- **Router Architecture**: The backend uses a modular router system with specialized endpoints for hooks, search, data, workers, and SSE streams. Key files include `hooks.ts`, `search.ts`, `data.ts`, and `workers.ts`.
- **Worker Management**: The workers router provides comprehensive API endpoints for spawning, terminating, and managing workers, with auto-spawn configuration support.
- **Performance Optimization**: Session enrichment logic was refactored to batch fetch observation counts and file stats, addressing N+1 query issues.
- **Real-time Communication**: The system uses a hybrid SSE/WebSocket architecture for real-time updates, with plans to unify under WebSocket.
- **Search Capabilities**: Supports both semantic (Qdrant) and full-text (SQLite FTS5) search with conditional vector database integration.
