## Key Insights

- **Observation Management Expansion**: Significant work on observation features including link management, pinning, and importance scoring, suggesting enhanced knowledge organization capabilities.
- **Memory Tiering System**: Implementation of Sleep Agent with memory tiering (core/working/archive/ephemeral) and consolidation logic for memory management.
- **Analytics Optimization**: Performance improvements through SQL aggregation and increased data fetch limits (10x increase to 100,000 records).
- **Router Architecture Growth**: Multiple new routers added (Decisions, Lazy, SleepAgent, Insights) following modular design patterns.
- **Design Pattern Refinement**: Refactoring of router setup methods from private to protected visibility, indicating architectural maturity.
