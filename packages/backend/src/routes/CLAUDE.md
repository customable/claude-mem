## Key Insights

- **Backend Architecture**: The project has a well-structured backend with modular routers (HealthRouter, DataRouter, WorkersRouter, etc.), each handling specific API endpoints.
- **Session Enrichment Optimization**: Refactored session enrichment logic to batch fetch observation counts and file stats, addressing N+1 query performance issues.
- **Search Functionality**: Implemented both semantic (Qdrant) and full-text (SQLite FTS5) search with fallback mechanisms and date range filtering.
- **Worker Management**: Comprehensive worker management API with auto-spawn configuration, spawning/termination endpoints, and status checks.
- **UI Improvements**: Recent focus on document preview modals, export functionality, title handling, and filtering enhancements.
