## Key Insights

- **API Expansion**: Added GDPR-compliant observation deletion endpoints and Git worktree support, enhancing data management and compliance.
- **Code Quality**: Refactored inline types to use shared interfaces (e.g., `ObservationQueryFilters`), improving maintainability.
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved worker termination logic and date range filter inconsistencies for better stability.
- **Discovery**: Mapped out backend API routes (sessions, observations, documents) and search endpoints (text/semantic).
- **Next Steps**: Merge resolved PRs (e.g., MCP server migration, refactoring) and verify build stability post-dependency updates.
