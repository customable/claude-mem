## Key Insights

- **Modular Architecture**: The backend follows a clean, modular router structure with 16+ distinct routers (e.g., PluginsRouter, SuggestionsRouter, SleepAgentRouter), each handling specific domains.
- **New Features Added**: Project settings, observation templates, observation links, and pinning/importance management were implemented with full CRUD API endpoints.
- **Search & AI Integration**: The search API currently uses text fallback for semantic search, indicating planned Qdrant integration for advanced search capabilities.
- **Worker Architecture**: A comprehensive in-process worker system was added with file-based mutex locks and lifecycle management, supporting spawn, in-process, and hybrid modes.
- **Refactoring**: The `setupRoutes` method visibility was changed from private to protected in DecisionsRouter, suggesting a design shift toward more flexible router initialization.
