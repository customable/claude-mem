## Key Insights

- **Router Architecture**: The backend uses a modular router system with 20+ specialized routers (e.g., HealthRouter, DataRouter, WorkersRouter), indicating a well-organized structure.
- **Worker Management**: The WorkersRouter provides comprehensive API endpoints for worker lifecycle management, including auto-spawn configuration.
- **Performance Optimization**: Session enrichment logic was refactored to batch fetch data, resolving an N+1 query problem.
- **Search Capabilities**: The system supports both semantic (Qdrant) and full-text (SQLite FTS5) search with fallback mechanisms.
- **Bun Migration**: Ongoing effort to replace Bun with Node-compatible alternatives due to compatibility issues, affecting documentation, build scripts, and Docker configurations.
