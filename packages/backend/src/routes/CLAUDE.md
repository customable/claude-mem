## Key Insights

- **Archived Outputs Feature**: Significant progress on implementing archived outputs functionality for "Endless Mode" (Issue #109), including 5 new API endpoints (list, search, stats, get by ID, get by observation ID) and standardized error handling.
- **SSE Integration**: Added SSEBroadcaster dependency to HooksRouter, enabling real-time updates. New writer pause/resume endpoints support git operations (Issue #288).
- **Backend Architecture**: Discovered well-organized modular router structure with 20+ specialized routers. DataRouter handles sessions, observations, documents, and analytics with session enrichment logic.
- **Refactoring**: Standardized error handling across archived outputs endpoints using Express response methods. BaseRouter class provides common utilities for route handlers.
- **Project Management**: Found project lifecycle operations (delete/archive/rename) and extensive use of project parameters across data routes for filtering and organization.
