## Key Insights

- **Archived Outputs Feature**: Extensive work on implementing archived outputs API endpoints for "Endless Mode" (Issue #109), including standardized error handling and dependency injection.
- **SSE Implementation**: Multiple discoveries around Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation, including StreamRouter class and SSEBroadcaster integration for real-time updates.
- **Backend Architecture**: Comprehensive exploration of backend routes structure, revealing modular design with 20+ specialized routers and consistent BaseRouter utilities.
- **Multi-tenancy Planning**: Research into multi-tenancy strategies (Column, Schema, Database) with PostgreSQL recommended for scalability, alongside SQLite fixes for short-term use.
- **Rebranding Initiative**: Plans to rebrand to "remembr" with domain acquisition and package renaming, alongside SaaS roadmap development.
