## Key Insights

- **Archived Outputs Feature**: Extensive work on implementing archived outputs API endpoints tied to "Endless Mode" (Issue #109), including standardized error handling and dependency injection.
- **SSE Implementation**: Deep exploration of Server-Sent Events (SSE) functionality through StreamRouter, revealing real-time communication patterns and SSEBroadcaster usage.
- **Backend Architecture**: Modular router structure discovered with 20+ specialized routers, showing well-organized separation of concerns in the backend.
- **Writer Control**: New WebSocket-based writer pause/resume endpoints added for git operations, indicating migration from SSE to WebSocket for real-time features.
- **Project Management**: API endpoints for project settings, deletion, and lifecycle management identified, showing comprehensive project handling capabilities.
