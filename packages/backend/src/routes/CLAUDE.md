## Key Insights

- **Performance Optimization**: Refactored session enrichment logic to batch fetch observation counts and file stats, eliminating N+1 query problem (Issue #202).
- **Database Structure**: System uses MikroORM with FTS5 for full-text search; identified missing indexes causing performance degradation.
- **Core Gaps**: Discovered issues with snippet saving, auto-spawning, and documentation accuracy post-major changes.
- **Next Steps**: Monitor performance post-optimization, implement fixes for core features, and update documentation.
- **Closed Issues**: Successfully resolved #201 and #202 with batch query methods and performance indexes.
