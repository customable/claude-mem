## Key Insights

- **Memory Tiering System**: New SleepAgentRouter and SleepAgentService introduced for memory tier management (core, working, archive, ephemeral tiers) with consolidation logic.
- **Router Architecture**: Backend follows modular router pattern with 14+ router classes (Health, Data, Insights, Decisions, LazyRouter, etc.) each handling specific domains.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Analytics timeline refactored to use SQL aggregation (~#13779), data fetch limit increased from 10K to 100K (~#13767).
- **New Features**: Added code snippet management (~#13509), 70+ achievements system, and conflict detection in DecisionsRouter.
- **Design Changes**: setupRoutes visibility changed from private to protected (~#13912), suggesting more flexible router inheritance patterns.
