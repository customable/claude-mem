## Key Insights

- **Semantic Search Progress**: Qdrant integration is partially implemented but falls back to SQLite FTS5. Enhanced API responses now include vector DB status.
- **Context Preservation**: Pre-compact hooks were added to preserve context before memory compaction (Issue #73), ensuring CLAUDE.md generation captures state.
- **File Tracking**: Sessions now aggregate file read/modified data across observations for better visibility.
- **System Maintenance**: New CleanupRouter addresses process/memory leaks (Issue #101) with stats and manual trigger endpoints.
- **Architecture**: Modular backend with 19+ routers, TypeScript, and plugin-based hooks. Recent additions include ShareRouter and PluginsRouter.
