## Key Insights

- **Worker Federation Progress**: Implemented HubsRouter and WorkerTokensRouter with full CRUD operations, supporting token-based authentication for distributed workers.
- **Archived Outputs Feature**: Added API endpoints for archived outputs (Issue #109) tied to "Endless Mode," with standardized error handling and compression status tracking.
- **SSE Implementation**: Discovered and analyzed the Server-Sent Events (SSE) system for real-time updates, including keepalive functionality and client management.
- **Modular Architecture**: Backend routes follow a modular pattern with 20+ specialized routers, each handling distinct domains (e.g., health checks, metrics, data operations).
- **TypeScript & Build Issues**: Identified remaining TypeScript errors (e.g., SSE event type mismatches) and CSS optimization warnings needing resolution before deployment.
