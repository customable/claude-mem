## Key Insights

- **Task Dispatcher Architecture**: The system uses a sophisticated task lifecycle management (pending → assigned → processing → completed/failed) with capability-based worker matching and SSE-based real-time updates.
- **Worker Management**: WebSocket-based worker connections with authentication, heartbeats, and lifecycle management. Localhost workers have different auth rules than external workers.
- **Code Snippet Extraction**: New functionality added to extract and store code snippets from observations, with language detection and normalization.
- **Worker Linking**: Enhanced worker management with spawned worker linking to hub workers and new `onWorkerLinked` callback for better lifecycle tracking.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented retry logic for failed tasks with configurable maximum retries before marking as failed.
