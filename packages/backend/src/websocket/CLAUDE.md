## Key Insights

- **WebSocket Architecture**: The system uses WebSocket-based worker management with heartbeat checks, authentication, and task distribution via `WorkerHub` and `TaskDispatcher`.
- **Task Handling**: The task dispatcher processes observation, summary, and compression tasks, broadcasting events via SSE and managing worker capabilities.
- **Compression Logic**: Recent refactoring improved compression status handling, with updates to `updateCompressionStatus` for better error management.
- **Endless Mode**: New features support Endless Mode (Issue #109), including compression task handling and archived output management.
- **CLAUDE.md Generation**: The task dispatcher tracks observation counts and triggers CLAUDE.md generation at configurable intervals.
