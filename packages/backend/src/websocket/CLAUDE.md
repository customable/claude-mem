## Key Insights

- **Code snippet bug identified**: Regex for extracting fenced code blocks was fixed to use `normalizedText` instead of `text`, resolving a parsing issue.
- **Task dispatcher logic**: Discovered regex-based parsing of code blocks, tool output handling, and observation workflows in `task-dispatcher.ts`.
- **Performance optimizations**: Added indexes and refactored session enrichment logic to resolve N+1 query problems.
- **UI/UX gaps**: Worker auto-spawning lacks visibility, and worker configuration needs a modal interface.
- **Next steps**: Fix code snippet saving, implement worker configuration modal, and monitor performance post-optimization.
