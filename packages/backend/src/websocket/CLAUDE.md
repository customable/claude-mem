## Key Insights

- **Worker Management Enhancements**: Significant improvements to worker connection handling, including WebSocket management, latency tracking, and worker linking capabilities. The system now supports better monitoring and debugging through enhanced logging and latency measurement.
- **Code Snippet Extraction**: Added comprehensive code snippet extraction functionality to the TaskDispatcher, including language detection, normalization, and storage capabilities. This extends the system's ability to handle code-related tasks.
- **Task Dispatcher Architecture**: The TaskDispatcher now supports a broader range of functionalities, including code snippet management, worker linking, and enhanced error handling with retry logic. This makes the system more robust and feature-rich.
- **Latency and Performance Tracking**: Implemented latency tracking for worker connections, enabling better performance monitoring and optimization. This includes ping/pong mechanisms and statistical analysis of worker responsiveness.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: The system leverages callbacks (e.g., `onWorkerLinked`) and WebSocket events for real-time notifications, improving the responsiveness and integration capabilities of the worker management system.
