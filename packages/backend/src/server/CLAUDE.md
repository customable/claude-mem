## Key Insights

- **Backend Service Architecture**: The backend service (`backend-service.ts`) is the core orchestrator, managing HTTP/WebSocket servers, database (MikroORM), and real-time communication (SSE, WebSocket). It initializes key components like `WorkerHub`, `SSEBroadcaster`, and routers for API endpoints.
- **Real-Time Communication**: The service heavily relies on WebSocket (`WorkerHub`) and SSE (`SSEBroadcaster`) for real-time worker communication and event broadcasting, with routes for hooks, data, and federation.
- **Modular Routing**: API routes are structured modularly (e.g., `DataRouter`, `HooksRouter`, `ExportRouter`), with rate limiting applied to sensitive endpoints (admin, worker spawning).
- **Database Integration**: MikroORM is used for database operations, with configurable support for SQLite and other databases. Services like `TaskService` and `SessionService` depend on ORM-managed repositories.
- **Recent Features**: Added `archivedOutputs` support to `DataRouter` and `TaskDispatcher`, enabling historical task output management. SSE broadcasting was integrated into `HooksRouter` for real-time hook events.
