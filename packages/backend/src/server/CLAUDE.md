| #86 | 11:38 AM | 🔵 | TaskDispatcher initialization and dependencies | ~1155 |

## Key Insights

- TaskDispatcher relies on multiple dependencies (workerHub, taskQueue, unitOfWork components) and initializes immediately.
- Performance optimizations completed: Added indexes, refactored session enrichment, and resolved N+1 query issues.
- UI/UX gaps identified: Worker auto-spawn lacks visibility, and code snippet saving is broken.
- Metrics tracked via Prometheus for HTTP requests, tasks, workers, and SSE connections.
- Next steps: Fix code snippet bug, implement worker configuration modal, and update documentation.
