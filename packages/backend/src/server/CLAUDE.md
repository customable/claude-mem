## Key Insights

- **Task Queue Optimization**: Implemented configurable timeouts and subdirectory limits for CLAUDE.md tasks to address queue overload issues.
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Identified task processing bottlenecks and distributed documentation across packages, requiring further optimization.
- **Modular Architecture**: Discovered key components like MikroORM repositories, WebSocket clients, and SSE Writer, indicating a structured but non-standard naming approach.
- **Next Steps**: Monitor task queue performance, investigate root causes of timeouts, and clarify missing file locations for deeper system understanding.
- **Documentation**: Distributed CLAUDE.md files across packages; consolidation may be needed for better maintainability.
