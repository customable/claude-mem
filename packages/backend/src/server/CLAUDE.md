## Key Insights

- **Architecture Discovery**: Extensive exploration of backend service architecture, revealing Express-based routing, MikroORM database integration, and WebSocket communication.
- **Feature Additions**: Added `archivedOutputs` to DataRouter and TaskDispatcher, extending functionality for historical data management.
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Enhanced HooksRouter with SSE broadcaster for real-time event broadcasting.
- **API Structure**: Discovered rate-limited API endpoints (search, analytics, export, import) with dependency injection patterns.
- **Optimization Focus**: Identified token compression (94.5% reduction) and UI build warnings as areas needing attention.
