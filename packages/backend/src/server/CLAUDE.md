## Key Insights

- **SSE Integration**: Added SSE broadcasting to HooksRouter (#1801) and discovered existing SSEBroadcaster usage (#1800), indicating real-time event capabilities are being expanded.
- **Architecture Discoveries**: Multiple observations (#1793, #456, #166) reveal the backend's core structure: Express-based HTTP server, MikroORM for DB, WebSocket for workers, and multi-service orchestration.
- **Task System Enhancements**: TaskDispatcher and TaskService now integrate archivedOutputs (#779, #765), suggesting improved output management and historical data access.
- **Initialization Flow**: Detailed backend service startup sequence documented (#778, #770), showing dependency injection patterns for core services.
- **Next Steps**: Need to address SSE-Writer Git conflicts (#288), modularize large UI components (#290), and fix achievement progress calculations.
