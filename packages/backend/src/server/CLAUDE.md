## Key Insights

- **Archived Outputs Integration**: TaskDispatcher and TaskService now include `archivedOutputs` dependency, enabling better output management and historical task data access.
- **Backend Service Architecture**: The system uses a hub-and-spoke model with WorkerHub managing WebSocket connections and TaskDispatcher handling task assignment.
- **Proposed Enhancements**: New architectural proposals include task priority systems, worker hub federation, and unified WebSocket management for distributed worker pools.
- **Database Evaluation**: Research into alternative database technologies (e.g., PostgreSQL) is underway for scalability and production readiness.
- **Decoupled Capabilities**: Worker capabilities are abstracted from providers, allowing flexible and extensible worker management.
