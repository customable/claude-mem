## Key Insights

- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Added comprehensive cleanup service with API route (`/api/cleanup`), automatic integration, and proper shutdown handling to address memory leaks (Issue #101).
- **New Features**: Implemented memory sharing (`ShareService`), plugin system (`PluginManager`), and AI-powered suggestions (`SuggestionService`), significantly expanding functionality.
- **Architecture**: Backend service acts as main orchestrator with Express routing, MikroORM database operations, and WebSocket communication, supporting multiple database types.
- **Critical Fixes**: Resolved CJS/ESM compatibility issues, null handling in workflows, and hook path expansion bugs.
- **Next Steps**: Address remaining TypeScript errors in `share-service.ts`, resolve CSS `@property` warnings, and test new features in production-like environments.
