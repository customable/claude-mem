## Key Insights

- **Archived Outputs Integration**: Multiple components (DataRouter, TaskDispatcher, TaskService) now include `archivedOutputs` dependency, indicating a new focus on historical data management.
- **SSE Expansion**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) functionality was added to HooksRouter, enabling real-time event broadcasting for hooks.
- **Backend Architecture**: The backend service orchestrates multiple services (WorkerHub, TaskDispatcher, SSEBroadcaster) with Express for HTTP routing and MikroORM for database operations.
- **API Structure**: Backend API routes are organized into groups (SSE, Data, Search, Export) with rate-limited endpoints for critical operations.
- **Refactoring Progress**: Settings.tsx was modularized into 17 files, and observation types were expanded to address inconsistencies in system prompts.
