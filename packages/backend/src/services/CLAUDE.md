## Key Insights

- **Memory Tiering System**: Implemented SleepAgentService for memory consolidation with tier promotion/demotion (core, working, archive, ephemeral) and cleanup functionality.
- **Worker Architecture**: WorkerProcessManager oversees worker lifecycle (spawn, exit, error) via WebSocket, with no "InProcessWorker" implementation found.
- **Error Handling**: Multiple fixes for error logging in lazy-processing-service, ensuring consistent structured error objects.
- **Achievement System**: Expanded with 70+ achievements across sessions, tokens, discoveries, and special categories to enhance user engagement.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Added robust fallback logic for empty daily stats in insights and activity heatmap to ensure data consistency.
