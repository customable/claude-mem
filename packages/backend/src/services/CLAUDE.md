## Key Insights

- **Memory Sharing & Privacy**: ShareService was created with robust null handling and privacy controls (full/anonymized sharing modes).
- **Service Architecture Growth**: Multiple new services added (SleepAgent, Decision, Suggestion, PluginManager) following consistent export patterns.
- **Error Handling Improvements**: Systematic fixes for error logging across services (lazy-processing, share-service).
- **Refactoring Trends**: Naming consistency improvements (SDKSessionRecord → SdkSessionRecord) and constant usage (DATA_DIR).
- **Core Functionality**: Sleep Agent handles memory tiering; Decision Service tracks conflicts; Suggestion Service provides AI-powered context-aware recommendations.
