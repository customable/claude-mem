## Key Insights

- **Worker Management Enhancements**: Added auto-restart with exponential backoff for crashed workers, graceful shutdown handling, and restart tracking. This improves system resilience.
- **Semantic Search Integration**: New imports for `SemanticSearchTask` suggest ongoing work to integrate semantic search capabilities, though Qdrant integration appears incomplete.
- **Pre-Compact Hooks**: Added `session:pre-compact` event type and related methods to preserve context before memory compaction, addressing potential data loss.
- **Cleanup Service**: Created a new `CleanupService` for maintenance tasks like stale session removal, addressing issue #101.
- **Bug Fixes**: Multiple null-handling fixes in sharing functionality and worker termination logic, improving stability.
