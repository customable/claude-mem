## Key Insights

- **SSE Event System**: The project uses a robust SSE (Server-Sent Events) system for real-time updates, with events for session management, task tracking, and worker status. New events (`writer:pause`, `writer:resume`) were added to handle CLAUDE.md writing during git operations.
- **Worker & Hub Management**: The `WorkerTokenService` and `HubRegistry` services manage worker authentication (SHA-256 tokens) and hub filtering (health, region, labels). These were recently exported for broader use.
- **Task & Backpressure**: The `TaskService` implements a backpressure mechanism (Issue #205) and supports "Endless Mode" for archiving outputs. Semantic search uses polling with a 30-second timeout.
- **Insights & Achievements**: The `insights-service` tracks daily stats and unlocks achievements based on user activity (e.g., first bugfix, discovery).
- **Federation Progress**: Recent work focused on hub federation (Issue #263), including UI components, backend APIs, and a `worker-hub` CLI. Some TypeScript errors remain in `backend-service.ts`.
