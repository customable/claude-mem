## Key Insights

- **SSE Event System**: The project uses a robust SSE (Server-Sent Events) system for real-time updates, with events like `writer:pause`, `writer:resume`, and `session:pre-compact` for managing UI state and session lifecycle.
- **Worker Federation**: Worker tokens, registrations, and hubs are managed via MikroORM, with heartbeat tracking and health status filtering for distributed worker management.
- **Task Management**: The task service implements backpressure handling, multiple task types (observation, summarization, embedding), and Endless Mode for archiving outputs.
- **Insights & Achievements**: The insights service tracks daily stats, bugfix counts, and unlocks achievements based on user activity thresholds.
- **Performance & Scalability**: Worker processes consume ~138MB each, and the system supports SQLite with potential PostgreSQL migration plans for scalability.
