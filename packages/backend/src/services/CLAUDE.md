## Key Insights

- **Achievement System Expansion**: The achievement system was significantly expanded with new categories (sessions, tokens, discoveries, special achievements) and additional tiers, enhancing user engagement.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple fixes were implemented to handle cases where daily stats are empty, ensuring the system always returns meaningful data by falling back to observations.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Added support for real-time progress updates via SSE broadcasting, including a new 'task:progress' event type.
- **Git Worktree Support**: Added support for Git worktree functionality in session creation, allowing sessions to work with different branches and repositories.
- **Code Cleanup**: Several refactoring efforts were made to remove unused methods and code, improving code maintainability.
