## Key Insights

- **SSE & Real-Time Architecture**: The project heavily uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time UI updates, with recent additions for writer pause/resume events and pre-compact notifications.
- **Task Management**: The Task Service implements sophisticated backpressure handling, multiple task types, and Endless Mode archiving with compression capabilities.
- **Insights & Achievements**: The insights service tracks daily stats and unlocks achievements based on user activity thresholds (observations, decisions, bugfixes).
- **Architecture Gaps**: No vector/semantic search implementation found in core services, and task queue functions are missing from backend services.
- **Recent Features**: Added Endless Mode for observation archiving, compression task queueing, and writer state management via SSE events.
