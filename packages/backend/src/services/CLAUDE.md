## Key Insights

- **SSE Broadcaster Enhancements**: Added writer pause/resume events (`writer:pause`, `writer:resume`) to support real-time UI updates during git operations.
- **Endless Mode Implementation**: Introduced archiving and compression logic for tool outputs, reducing token usage by ~94.5% (Issue #109).
- **Task Service Architecture**: Discovered backpressure handling, task prioritization, and multi-type task support (observation, summarization, compression).
- **Insights Service**: Found achievement unlocking logic and daily statistics tracking for user activity metrics.
- **Missing Features**: No vector/semantic search in `session-service.ts` or task queue functions in backend services—potential gaps for future development.
