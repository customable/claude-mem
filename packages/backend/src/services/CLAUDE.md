## Key Insights

- **Endless Mode Implementation**: Significant progress on Endless Mode (Issue #109) with archiving logic, compression capabilities, and fallback mechanisms added to TaskService.
- **SSE Event System Expansion**: New writer pause/resume events added to SSEEventType and SSEBroadcaster, enhancing real-time UI control during git operations.
- **Task Management Enhancements**: Backpressure mechanism (Issue #205) and compression task queueing improve system reliability and performance.
- **Architecture Discoveries**: Deep exploration of core services (TaskService, SessionService, SSEBroadcaster) revealing event-driven architecture and worker management patterns.
- **Type System Improvements**: Added new observation fields (concept, gitBranch, decisionCategory) and expanded observation types for better data consistency.
