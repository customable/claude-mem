## Key Insights

- **SSE-Writer Enhancements**: Added `writer:pause` and `writer:resume` events to prevent Git conflicts during CLAUDE.md updates (Issues #1836, #1835, #1809, #1798).
- **Endless Mode Implementation**: Introduced compression task queueing and archived output handling for Endless Mode (Issues #763, #762, #759).
- **Task Deduplication**: Fixed duplicate `claude-md` tasks by implementing `createIfNotExists` (Issue #141).
- **Backpressure Handling**: Task Service includes queue limits to prevent overload (Issues #218, #423).
- **UI Refactoring Needed**: Large components like `Settings.tsx` require modularization for maintainability.
