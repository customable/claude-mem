## Key Insights

- **Task Service** manages 5 task types (observation, summarize, embedding, context-generate, claude-md) with priority-based execution.
- **Session Service** handles session lifecycle, prompt tracking, and observation management, forming the core business logic.
- **Claude-MD tasks** are created with observations/summaries data and prioritized lower than core tasks.
- **SSE Broadcaster** enables real-time updates, including CLAUDE.md readiness notifications.
- **Directory mismatch errors** in SSE-Writer logs need resolution for consistent CLAUDE.md file generation.
