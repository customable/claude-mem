## Key Insights

- **Task Deduplication Implemented**: Changed from `create` to `createIfNotExists` with SHA-256 hashing to prevent duplicate `claude-md` tasks (Issue #207 resolved).
- **Worker Process Management**: Uses EventEmitter pattern for spawning/managing worker processes (internal/external).
- **Performance Optimizations**: Fixed N+1 query issues, added database indexes, and normalized newlines in code snippet extraction.
- **Testing Needed**: Verify deduplication under load, validate code snippet extraction in production, and monitor database performance.
- **Open Tasks**: Address endless mode and plugin features post-stabilization.
