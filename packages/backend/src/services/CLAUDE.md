## Key Insights

- **Endless Mode Implementation**: Significant progress on Endless Mode (Issue #109) with archiving logic, compression capabilities, and task queueing functionality added to TaskService.
- **SSE Event System Expansion**: New writer pause/resume events added to SSEEventType and SSEBroadcaster, enhancing real-time UI control.
- **Task Management Architecture**: Deep analysis of TaskService reveals sophisticated backpressure handling and multiple task types (observation, summarization, compression, etc.).
- **Session Service Discoveries**: SessionService handles prompt filtering and subagent event tracking, with methods for observation queuing and session completion.
- **Performance Bottleneck**: Endless Mode v7.1 has synchronous 110s latency per tool use that needs optimization (asynchronous compression).
