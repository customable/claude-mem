## Key Insights

- **Session Service Refactoring**: Major cleanup in `session-service.ts` including removal of unused methods (`getWorkingDirectories`, `maybeQueueClaudeMd`), imports (`fs`, `path`, `loadSettings`), and constants (`CLAUDEMD_INTERVAL`). CLAUDE.md generation logic moved to task-dispatcher.
- **SSE Broadcaster Optimization**: Removed unused methods (`getClientCount`, `hasClients`, `broadcastProcessingStatus`) and event type (`processing:status`) from SSE broadcaster, streamlining real-time updates.
- **Worker Process Improvements**: Added `windowsHide: true` to prevent visible console windows on Windows, ensuring cleaner worker process management.
- **Task Prioritization**: CLAUDE.md generation tasks (`claude-md`) were deprioritized (lowest priority), reflecting a design decision to prioritize core functionality over documentation.
- **Architecture Clarity**: Deep analysis of core services (Session, Task, SSE Broadcaster) revealed their roles in session lifecycle, task queuing, and real-time UI updates, providing a clear understanding of backend workflows.
