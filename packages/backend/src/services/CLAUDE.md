## Key Insights

- **Memory Sharing & Privacy**: ShareService was created with robust privacy controls (privacyLevel handling) and null safety improvements across multiple methods.
- **Plugin System**: New PluginManager service enables custom observation processing with lifecycle management (load/unload).
- **AI Suggestions**: SuggestionService introduced for context-aware memory recommendations using multiple matching strategies.
- **Architecture**: Multiple backend services added (SleepAgent, DecisionService) with consistent export patterns in services index.
- **Error Handling**: Systematic fixes for null safety and error logging across services (lazy-processing, session handling).
