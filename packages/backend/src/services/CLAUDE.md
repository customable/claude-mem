## Key Insights

- **Task Prioritization**: CLAUDE.md generation tasks were deprioritized (lowest priority) to prevent queue overload, reflecting a design decision to prioritize core tasks (observations, summaries) over documentation.
- **Architecture Refinement**: CLAUDE.md generation logic was moved from `session-service` to `task-dispatcher`, improving separation of concerns and centralizing task management.
- **Code Cleanup**: Unused imports, methods (`maybeQueueClaudeMd`), and constants (`CLAUDEMD_INTERVAL`) were removed, improving maintainability.
- **Configurable Limits**: Added `CLAUDEMD_TASK_TIMEOUT` and `CLAUDEMD_MAX_SUBDIRS` settings to control task execution and scope, addressing performance bottlenecks.
- **SSE Integration**: The SSE broadcaster service notifies clients when CLAUDE.md is ready, ensuring real-time updates for documentation generation.
