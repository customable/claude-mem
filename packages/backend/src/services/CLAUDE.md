## Key Insights

- **New Services Added**: PluginManager, SuggestionService, SleepAgentService, DecisionService, and LazyProcessingService were all created and integrated into the backend services index.
- **Error Handling Improvements**: Multiple fixes were made to error logging in the lazy-processing-service to ensure consistent error message formatting.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Several services (InsightsService, LazyProcessingService) now include fallback logic to handle cases where daily_stats are empty, improving robustness.
- **Worker Architecture**: The WorkerProcessManager was reviewed and documented, revealing its role in managing worker child processes and lifecycle.
- **Achievement System Expansion**: The achievement system was significantly expanded with new categories and tiers, enhancing user engagement features.
