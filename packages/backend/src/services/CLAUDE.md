## Key Insights

- **Worker Process Management**: Discovered and fixed Windows-specific worker process spawning issues (windowsHide option added)
- **Task Prioritization**: CLAUDE.md generation tasks were deprioritized (now lowest priority) to focus on core functionality
- **Architecture Shift**: CLAUDE.md generation moved from SessionService to TaskDispatcher, improving separation of concerns
- **Code Cleanup**: Multiple refactoring operations removed unused code (CLAUDEMD_INTERVAL, maybeQueueClaudeMd, loadSettings import)
- **Real-time Features**: SSE broadcaster service handles CLAUDE.md readiness notifications, part of the real-time update system
