## Key Insights

- **CAPSLOCK Detection Feature**: Implemented `isUrgent` parameter across session management and prompt recording to support CAPSLOCK/urgent detection (Issue #233).
- **Semantic Search Enhancements**: Added synchronous execution for semantic search with Qdrant integration, including polling and timeout mechanisms.
- **Worker Management Improvements**: Introduced auto-restart for crashed workers with exponential backoff and proper cleanup during termination.
- **Event System Refinements**: Enhanced SSE broadcasting with new event types (e.g., `session:pre-compact`) and refactored event handling logic.
- **System Maintenance**: Added cleanup services to prevent process/memory leaks and integrated them into the services index.
