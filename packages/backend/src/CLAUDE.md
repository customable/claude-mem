## Key Insights

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Multiple test suites were created for core components (SearchRouter, DataRouter, TaskService, BaseRouter, HealthRouter), indicating a focus on improving code reliability and maintainability.
- **Runtime Migration**: The project is transitioning from Bun to Node.js, as evidenced by CLI execution method updates and the removal of Bun references.
- **API Structure**: The backend API routes for documents, sessions, and search functionality were thoroughly analyzed, revealing a well-structured Express router with multiple endpoints.
- **Task Management**: The TaskService architecture was examined, showing a sophisticated system with backpressure handling and multiple task types (observation, summarization, embedding, etc.).
- **Error Handling**: Several bug fixes and improvements were made to error handling, particularly in parameter parsing and CLI error logging.
