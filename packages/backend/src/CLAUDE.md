## Key Insights

- **Architecture Overview**: The system uses a hub-and-spoke architecture with WebSocket-based worker communication, SSE for real-time UI updates, and a capability-based task routing system. Key components include WorkerHub, TaskDispatcher, and SSEBroadcaster.
- **Task Management**: The task dispatcher processes different task types including 'observation' and 'summarize'. It stores results in the database with metadata like title, text, and extracted facts.
- **Worker Management**: The Worker Hub manages WebSocket connections from workers, handling authentication, heartbeats, and connection lifecycle. It uses the 'ws' library for WebSocket communication.
- **Backend Service**: The BackendService class serves as the main orchestrator for the backend server. It manages initialization of multiple services (WorkerHub, TaskDispatcher, SSEBroadcaster, etc.), HTTP server setup, and route configuration.
- **Future Improvements**: Proposals for worker specialization, federation architecture, and a unified WebSocket system have been created. The system has potential for federation and uses a modular design with separate packages for different functionalities.
