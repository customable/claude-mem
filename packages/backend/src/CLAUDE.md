## Key Insights

- **Task Management System**: The task dispatcher and service architecture is sophisticated, handling multiple task types (observations, summaries, embeddings) with backpressure management and worker matching.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: SSE (Server-Sent Events) is heavily used for real-time communication, with a dedicated broadcaster service managing various event types.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Multiple comprehensive test suites were created for core components (SearchRouter, DataRouter, TaskService, BaseRouter, HealthRouter), indicating a strong focus on test coverage.
- **Migration from Bun to Node.js**: The CLI execution method was changed from Bun to Node.js, suggesting a runtime shift in the project.
- **Metrics and Monitoring**: The backend uses Prometheus for monitoring HTTP requests, task processing, and worker utilization with a well-structured metrics initialization process.
