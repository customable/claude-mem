## Key Insights

- **Backpressure Mechanism Implemented**: Added `maxPendingTasks` configuration and `checkBackpressure()` method to `TaskService` to prevent queue overload (Issue #205).
- **Rate Limiting Added**: Comprehensive rate limiting middleware implemented for API routes (standard, expensive operations, search, worker spawning, etc.) to prevent abuse.
- **Cache Improvements**: Fixed TypeScript generic type inconsistencies in `CacheManager` and added cache management endpoints (`/api/cache/stats`, `/api/cache/clear`).
- **Batch Operations**: Replaced individual deletes with batch operations in `DataRouter` to improve performance (Issue #204).
- **Observability & Performance**: Enhanced observability (tracing, metrics) and addressed N+1 query issues in `DataRouter.listSessions()`.
