## Key Insights

- **Endless Mode Implementation**: Significant progress on Endless Mode (Issue #109) with archived outputs API endpoints, compression logic, and UI components. The synchronous implementation causes 110s latency per tool use, requiring async optimization.
- **Archived Outputs System**: New API endpoints for archived outputs (list, search, stats, get by ID/observation ID) were added, along with MikroORM entity relations and repository dependencies.
- **Backend Architecture**: Discovered modular router structure with 20+ specialized routers, BaseRouter utilities, and standardized error handling patterns.
- **Task System**: TaskService implements backpressure mechanism (Issue #205) and handles compression tasks, while task-dispatcher processes archived outputs.
- **UI Improvements**: Settings.tsx was refactored into 17 modular files, and new dashboard widgets (EndlessModeCard) and settings UI (ProcessingSettings) were added for Endless Mode.
