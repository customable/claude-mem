## Key Insights

- **Archived Outputs Feature Development**: Significant work on implementing archived outputs functionality for Endless Mode (Issue #109), including new API endpoints, error handling standardization, and DataRouter integration.
- **Backend Architecture**: Discovered a well-organized backend with modular routers (20+ specialized routers) and clear separation of concerns across Health, Data, Workers, and other domains.
- **SSE Integration**: Added Server-Sent Events (SSE) capabilities to HooksRouter for real-time updates, including writer pause/resume functionality for git operations.
- **Task Management**: Explored TaskService with backpressure mechanism (Issue #205) and compression task handling logic in task-dispatcher.ts.
- **UI Refactoring**: Completed modularization of Settings.tsx (17 files) and addressed system prompt inconsistencies, with TypeScript checks passing across most packages.
