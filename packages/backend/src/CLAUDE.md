## Key Insights

- **Performance Optimization**: Refactored session enrichment logic to batch queries, fixing N+1 query problem (Issue #202) and improving efficiency.
- **Task Dispatcher Architecture**: Discovered TaskDispatcher's role in handling tool outputs, observations, and code snippet extraction via regex-based parsing.
- **CodeSnippets Feature**: Confirmed backend implementation with repository integration and API endpoints.
- **Database Insights**: System uses MikroORM with FTS5 for full-text search; missing indexes were identified and addressed.
- **Next Steps**: Monitor performance post-optimization, implement fixes for code snippet saving/auto-spawning, and update documentation.
