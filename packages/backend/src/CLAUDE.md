## Key Insights

- **Worker Management**: WorkerHub is a core component managing WebSocket connections, with auto-restart logic for crashed workers using exponential backoff.
- **Semantic Search**: Qdrant integration is partially implemented but falls back to SQLite FTS5; API responses now include vector DB status.
- **Context Preservation**: Pre-compact hooks and SSE broadcasting ensure context is preserved before memory compaction.
- **Architecture**: The project uses TypeScript, SSE for real-time updates, and a plugin-based hook system.
- **Bug Fixes**: Addressed undefined `workingDirectory` in CLAUDE.md generation and orphaned worker restart timers.
