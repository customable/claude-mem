## Key Insights

- **Achievement System**: The `insights-service.ts` handles achievement unlocking logic, including bugfix tracking and daily stats updates. A bug in progress calculation prevents partial achievements from being tracked.
- **Archived Outputs**: New API endpoints for archived outputs were added, but the feature depends on "Endless Mode" and lacks a stats endpoint. Error handling was standardized across these endpoints.
- **Backend Structure**: The backend uses a modular router architecture with specialized routers (e.g., Data, Search, Export). The `DataRouter` was extended to support archived outputs.
- **Semantic Search**: Uses a polling mechanism in `task-service.ts` but lacks vector database or Qdrant synchronization. No task queue functions were found in backend services.
- **Next Steps**: Fix SSE writer path handling, implement achievement progress calculation, and add the missing `GET /api/data/archived-outputs/stats` endpoint.
