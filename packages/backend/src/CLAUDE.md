## Key Insights

- **Worker Management**: Discovered and refined worker termination logic, including safety checks for unconnected workers and Windows-specific fixes (`windowsHide` option).
- **GDPR Compliance**: Added deletion endpoints for observations, sessions, and documents, ensuring data privacy compliance.
- **Search Functionality**: Explored and documented search endpoints (text, semantic, and combined) and document search capabilities.
- **Task Prioritization**: Adjusted task priorities and timeouts, particularly for `claude-md` tasks, to optimize system performance.
- **Architecture**: Gained deeper understanding of the task dispatcher, worker spawning, and API route structures.
