## Key Insights

- **WebSocket Architecture**: The system uses WebSocket-based worker management with heartbeat checks, authentication, and task distribution via `WorkerHub` and `TaskDispatcher`.
- **SSE Implementation**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) are used for real-time updates, with a `StreamRouter` handling SSE connections and broadcasting task/worker events.
- **Task Handling**: The `task-dispatcher` manages working directories, CLAUDE.md generation, and SSE broadcasting for task lifecycle events.
- **CLI Structure**: The backend service CLI supports `start`, `stop`, and `status` commands, with file logging and HTTP endpoints.
- **Worker Management**: Workers are tracked via `ConnectedWorker` interfaces, including capabilities, heartbeat, and task assignment status.

## Next Steps
- Implement configurable modes and git hooks for team collaboration.
- Address API authentication failures and SQLite lock contention issues.
- Optimize token usage and explore alternative domain naming strategies.
