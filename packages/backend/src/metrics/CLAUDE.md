## Key Insights

- **Metrics System Overhaul**: Major refactoring of the metrics system to use interface-based Prometheus configuration, replacing hardcoded definitions with a centralized config file.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: The system now tracks HTTP requests, task processing, worker utilization, sessions, and database operations via Prometheus.
- **MikroORM Entity Refactoring**: Planned refactoring of MikroORM entities to ensure database-agnostic design and proper relationship handling.
- **Embedding Provider Abstraction**: Implemented a registry pattern for multiple embedding providers (local, Mistral) with priority-based capability resolution.
- **Architecture Proposals**: New task priority system and worker hub federation architecture proposed for future implementation.
