## Key Insights

- **Metrics Refactoring**: The project has undergone significant refactoring to replace hardcoded metrics with a configuration-based approach using TypeScript interfaces, improving maintainability.
- **Centralized Monitoring**: A new centralized metrics configuration file was added, consolidating all Prometheus metrics (HTTP requests, tasks, workers, sessions, etc.) for better observability.
- **Task Deduplication**: Implemented task deduplication using SHA-256 hashing to prevent queue overload, addressing a critical scalability concern.
- **UI Enhancements**: Added a worker auto-spawn status UI, improving operational visibility and control.
- **Documentation Focus**: Recent efforts include documenting the package structure and architecture, closing gaps in task/plan feature documentation.

## Next Steps
- Monitor task deduplication effectiveness under load.
- Verify worker auto-spawn reliability in production.
- Test code snippet extraction fixes in real-world scenarios.
- Continue refining metrics and task/plan management features.
