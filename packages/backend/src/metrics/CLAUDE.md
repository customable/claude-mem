## Key Insights

- **Task Deduplication**: Implemented SHA-256 hashing for `deduplication_key` to prevent duplicate task processing.
- **Code Snippet Fix**: Resolved extraction issues by normalizing escaped newlines in API outputs.
- **Performance**: Optimized session queries with batch operations to address N+1 query problems.
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive Prometheus metrics now track HTTP requests, task processing, and database operations.
- **Next Steps**: Test deduplication under load, verify snippet extraction in production, and monitor database performance.
