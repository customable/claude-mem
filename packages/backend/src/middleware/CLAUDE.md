## Key Insights

- **Comprehensive middleware expansion**: Added rate limiting, caching, metrics, request logging, and request ID middleware, significantly enhancing backend capabilities.
- **Observability improvements**: Implemented Prometheus metrics, structured logging, and request tracing for better system monitoring.
- **Performance focus**: Addressed caching gaps (ETag support, LRU caching) and N+1 query issues to optimize critical endpoints.
- **Architecture discovery**: Documented middleware structure, revealing available components (error handling, auth, logging) and their organization.
- **Next steps**: Resolve port conflicts, test cache invalidation under load, and expand metrics coverage to additional components.
