## Key Insights

- **Cleanup Service Feature**: A comprehensive cleanup service was implemented with configurable intervals, timeouts, and auto-enable settings, adding four new configuration options to manage memory and task cleanup.
- **In-Process Worker Enhancements**: New worker modes (spawn/in-process/hybrid) were introduced with file-based locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent worker registration, improving resource management.
- **Lazy Mode Processing**: Added token-efficient processing modes (normal/lazy/hybrid) with configurable batch intervals and conditional processing, optimizing memory usage.
- **Sleep Agent Feature**: Implemented memory consolidation functionality with configurable intervals and idle timeouts, disabled by default.
- **Settings System Exploration**: Extensive review of the type-safe, extensible configuration system with three priority levels (defaults, file, environment variables), supporting multiple AI providers and database configurations.
