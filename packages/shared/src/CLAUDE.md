## Key Insights

- **Endless Mode Feature**: Significant progress on implementing Endless Mode (Issue #109) with multiple configuration settings added for real-time context compression, including timeout thresholds and compression model specifications.
- **Configuration System**: The project uses a robust type-safe settings system with three priority levels (defaults, settings file, environment variables) supporting various features like remote mode, retention policies, and worker capabilities.
- **Logging Enhancements**: Added comprehensive file logging support (Issue #251) with daily rotation, automatic cleanup, and environment-based configuration, improving observability.
- **Offline Capabilities**: Implemented OfflineQueue for graceful degradation when backend is unreachable, with atomic file operations and retry management.
- **Secret Detection**: Comprehensive utility for detecting and redacting sensitive information with high entropy analysis and pattern matching for various API keys and credentials.
