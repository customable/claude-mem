## Key Insights

- **Endless Mode Development**: Significant progress on Endless Mode feature (Issue #109) with multiple configuration settings added for real-time context compression, including timeout thresholds and compression model selection.
- **Logging Enhancements**: File logging support was implemented (Issue #251) with daily rotation, automatic cleanup, and environment-based configuration, improving observability.
- **Offline Capabilities**: Offline queue functionality was added (Issue #253) to handle graceful degradation when backend is unreachable, using atomic file operations for reliability.
- **Configuration System**: The project uses a robust type-safe settings system with three priority levels (defaults, settings file, environment variables) supporting various features like remote mode and secret detection.
- **Testing Improvements**: Comprehensive test suites were added for both constants module and secret-detector module, ensuring reliability of core utilities.
