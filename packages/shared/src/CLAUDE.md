## Key Insights

- **Worker Auto-Restart**: Implemented with configurable policies (never/on-failure/always), max restarts, delay, and exponential backoff.
- **Cleanup Service**: Added with auto-enable, interval, stale timeout, and task age settings for memory management.
- **In-Process Worker**: New mode with timeout, idle exit, and file-based locking mechanism for concurrent operation safety.
- **Configuration System**: Type-safe settings management with defaults, file, and environment variable priority levels.
- **Feature Additions**: Sleep Agent for memory consolidation, Lazy Mode for token efficiency, and comprehensive secret detection utility.
