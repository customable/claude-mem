## Key Insights

- **Cleanup Service Implementation**: A comprehensive cleanup service was added with configurable intervals, timeouts, and auto-enable settings, suggesting a focus on memory management and resource cleanup.
- **Worker Mode Enhancements**: New in-process worker functionality was introduced with file-based locking and configurable modes (spawn/in-process/hybrid), indicating improved concurrency handling.
- **Lazy Mode for Efficiency**: Added Lazy Mode settings for token efficiency, including batch processing and conditional processing options, showing optimization efforts for resource usage.
- **Sleep Agent Feature**: Implemented Sleep Agent configuration for memory consolidation, suggesting background processing capabilities for memory optimization.
- **Settings System Maturity**: The settings management system is robust with type-safe configuration, multiple priority levels, and support for various data types, indicating a well-structured configuration approach.
