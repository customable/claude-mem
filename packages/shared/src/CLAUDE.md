## Key Insights

- **Embedding Provider System**: New configuration options for embedding providers (local/mistral) were added to settings, addressing Issue #112. This expands system flexibility for different embedding backends.
- **Endless Mode Feature**: Multiple settings for "Endless Mode" (Issue #109) were implemented, including compression, timeout, and fallback configurations for real-time context compression.
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test suites were created for core modules (SettingsManager, paths, secret-detector, constants), ensuring robust validation of configuration and utility functions.
- **Offline Queue**: Implemented graceful degradation with OfflineQueue class (Issue #253) using atomic file operations for event queuing when backend is unreachable.
- **Configuration System**: The type-safe settings system with three priority levels (defaults, settings file, environment variables) was thoroughly explored and tested, confirming its extensibility.
