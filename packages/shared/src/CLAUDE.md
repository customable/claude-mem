## Key Insights

- **In-Process Worker Architecture**: New configuration settings for in-process worker functionality were added, including worker mode options ('spawn', 'in-process', 'hybrid'), timeout settings, and a file-based lock mechanism to manage concurrent operations.
- **Lazy Mode and Sleep Agent**: Features for token efficiency (Lazy Mode) and memory consolidation (Sleep Agent) were introduced, with configurable intervals, timeouts, and processing modes.
- **Settings Management**: The settings system is robust, supporting type-safe configurations with three priority levels (defaults, file, environment variables) and includes mechanisms for legacy key migration.
- **AI Provider Fallback**: A new `AI_PROVIDER_FALLBACK` setting was added to support priority-based fallback for AI providers, enhancing system resilience.
- **Secret Detection**: New settings for secret detection were introduced, allowing configurable modes ('redact', 'skip', 'warn') to handle sensitive data in the system.
