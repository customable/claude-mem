## Key Insights

- Major focus on test suite expansion and refactoring, particularly for core modules (paths, SettingsManager, constants, secret-detector)
- Test coverage now includes environment variable handling, type parsing, error conditions, and secret detection patterns
- Architecture proposals completed for worker hub federation, task priority system, and unified WebSocket management
- Current system uses abstract capabilities with provider implementations, suggesting a plugin-like architecture
- Next steps involve implementing proposed architectural changes and evaluating database options for production
