## Key Insights

- **Repository Pattern**: The project uses a well-structured repository pattern (e.g., `IObservationRepository`, `ISessionRepository`) for data access abstraction, enabling multi-database support.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Batch query methods (`getCountsBySessionIds`, `getFileStatsBySessionIds`) were added to address N+1 query inefficiencies.
- **UI/UX Gaps**: Worker auto-spawning lacks UI feedback, and code snippet saving is broken—issues have been created for these.
- **Metrics Tracking**: Prometheus monitors HTTP requests, tasks, workers, and SSE connections for system health.
- **Next Steps**: Focus on fixing code snippet bugs, implementing worker configuration modals, and applying database migrations.
