## Key Insights

- **Significant refactoring**: Multiple files underwent cleanup, removing unused interfaces, functions, and duplicate definitions (e.g., `capabilities.ts`, `websocket.ts`, `database.ts`).
- **Type system exploration**: Extensive discovery of TypeScript types for API, WebSocket, database models, and worker capabilities, revealing the project's architecture.
- **Database model changes**: Observation type and concept definitions were moved or refactored, separating UI metadata from core types.
- **API restructuring**: API types exports were removed from the main types index, suggesting a reorganization of type exports.
- **Worker capabilities**: The system for worker registration and task assignment was explored, showing a robust capability-based task distribution mechanism.
