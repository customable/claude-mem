## Key Insights

- **Type System Expansion**: Multiple new type exports added (hub federation, user tasks, channel types) extending the shared TypeScript architecture.
- **WebSocket Protocol**: Comprehensive discovery of backend-worker communication patterns including auth, task management, and heartbeats.
- **Task Management**: User task system with lifecycle states (pending/in_progress/completed) and external ID support identified.
- **Repository Pattern**: Consistent use of repository interfaces across observations, tasks, and search functionality with BM25 scoring.
- **Federation Progress**: Hub federation feature nearing completion with UI components, backend services, and worker-hub CLI implemented.
