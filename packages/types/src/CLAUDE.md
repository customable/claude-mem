## Key Insights

- **Repository Interface**: Core data access operations for observations are defined in `IObservationRepository`, including CRUD methods and search capabilities.
- **Observation Types**: The system categorizes work into 18 observation types (e.g., bugfix, feature, refactor) as defined in `database.ts`.
- **Task System**: The backend-worker architecture assigns tasks (observation, summarization, embedding) based on worker capabilities.
- **Modular Monorepo**: The project uses a modular structure with packages for backend, database, and hooks, leveraging Forgejo for CI/CD.
- **Next Steps**: Focus on implementing Endless Mode, addressing process/memory leaks, and refining Docker documentation.
