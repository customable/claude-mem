| #68 | 11:33 AM | 🟠 | Added batch query methods for observation stats | ~5475 |
| #65 | 11:33 AM | 🔵 | Repository Pattern Implementation in claude-mem | ~5228 |

## Key Insights

- **Performance Optimizations**: Added batch query methods (`getCountsBySessionIds`, `getFileStatsBySessionIds`) to resolve N+1 query issues in session listing.
- **Repository Pattern**: Discovered the use of repository interfaces (e.g., `IObservationRepository`) for abstracted data access, supporting multi-database compatibility.
- **Database Insights**: System uses MikroORM with FTS5 for full-text search; missing indexes and inefficient queries were identified and addressed.
- **Next Steps**: Monitor performance post-optimization, apply migrations in production, and verify fixes for snippet saving and auto-spawning.
- **Documentation Gaps**: Identified need for updates post-major changes, including worker configuration modal and core feature documentation.
