## Key Insights

- **Repository Pattern & Unit of Work**: The project uses a robust repository pattern with a Unit of Work implementation, supporting multiple database backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL). This abstraction layer centralizes access to repositories like sessions, observations, and summaries.
- **Learning Insights Dashboard**: A new feature was added with comprehensive analytics capabilities, including daily stats, technology usage tracking, and achievements. This required extending the Unit of Work interface and adding new repository interfaces.
- **Code Snippets Feature**: A parallel development effort introduced a code snippet management system with CRUD operations, requiring resolution of merge conflicts in the repository interfaces.
- **Git Worktree Support**: Enhanced session management with optional fields (`repo_path`, `is_worktree`, `branch`) to support Git worktree functionality.
- **Merge Conflicts Resolved**: Multiple merge conflicts were detected and resolved, particularly in the `IUnitOfWork` interface and repository implementations, ensuring smooth integration of new features.
