## Key Insights

- **WebSocket Protocol & Worker Communication**: Extensive exploration of WebSocket protocol types for backend-worker communication, including authentication, task management, and heartbeat mechanisms.
- **User Task System**: New user task types and repository interfaces were added, supporting CLI tool integration and status lifecycle management.
- **Compression Capability**: Added support for 'compression' capability in the worker system, tied to Endless Mode (Issue #109), including legacy capability parsing and conversion.
- **TypeScript Types Expansion**: Multiple exports added to the shared TypeScript types index, enhancing modularity and reusability across the project.
- **Repository Pattern**: Discovered and documented repository pattern implementations for data access, including search functionality with BM25 scoring and session management.
