## Key Insights

- **Git Worktree Support Added**: New fields (`repoPath`, `isWorktree`, `branch`) were added to `CreateSessionInput`, `UpdateSessionInput`, and `CreateObservationInput` to support Git worktree functionality.
- **Repository Pattern**: A comprehensive Repository Pattern implementation was discovered, defining interfaces for multiple repositories (Session, Observation, Summary, Document, User).
- **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Merge conflict markers were detected and resolved in `database.ts`, ensuring code cleanliness.
- **Refactoring Efforts**: Multiple refactoring activities were observed, including the removal of duplicate interfaces, utility functions, and unused exports (e.g., `API types`, `CapabilityConfig`).
- **Type System Exploration**: The project's architecture was explored through its TypeScript types, revealing modules for database, API, WebSocket protocol, worker capabilities, and tasks.
