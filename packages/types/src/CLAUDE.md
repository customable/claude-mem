## Key Insights

- **Endless Mode Implementation**: Significant progress on Endless Mode (Issue #109) with compression capabilities added across the system, including new task types, worker capabilities, and repository interfaces.
- **User Task System**: New UserTask entity and repository interface were added for tracking CLI tool tasks, extending the system's functionality.
- **Type System Expansion**: Multiple TypeScript type definitions were discovered and expanded, including observation types, repository patterns, and worker capabilities.
- **Compression Effectiveness**: Compression reduces token usage by ~94.5%, with 'Edit' and 'Read' tools being the most resource-intensive.
- **Architecture Discoveries**: Explored and documented key architectural components like the task queue system, repository patterns, and worker capabilities decoupling.
