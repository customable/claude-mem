## Key Insights

- **WebSocket Protocol & Real-Time Communication**: Extensive exploration of WebSocket protocol types for backend-worker communication, including authentication, task management, and heartbeat mechanisms. Key progress in implementing channel-based subscriptions and migrating SSE-Writer to WebSocket.
- **Task System Architecture**: Discovered a robust task system with 8 task types (e.g., observation, summarization, compression) and a priority-based queue with status tracking. The system supports worker capabilities and Endless Mode (Issue #109).
- **Repository Pattern & Database Types**: Identified repository interfaces (e.g., `IObservationLinkRepository`, `IUserTaskRepository`) and database model types for observations, sessions, and projects. The `text` field in `CreateObservationInput` was made optional.
- **TypeScript Types & Exports**: Added exports for user task types and channel types to the main types index, extending shared TypeScript types for the claude-mem system. Resolved type mismatches in `@claude-mem/types`.
- **Next Steps**: Complete the migration of SSE-Writer to WebSocket, integrate `ChannelManager` with `WorkerHub`, and ensure all real-time events work seamlessly across clients. Test the unified WebSocket system end-to-end.
