## Key Insights

- **Task System Architecture**: The backend creates tasks (observation, summarization, embedding) and assigns them to workers based on capabilities. Task statuses include pending, assigned, processing, completed, and failed.
- **Database Model**: The `database.ts` file defines 18 observation types (bugfix, feature, refactor, etc.) and interfaces for documents, sessions, and observations.
- **Endless Mode Limitation**: Current synchronous processing in Endless Mode causes latency issues, requiring optimization or asynchronous implementation.
- **Proposed MCP Tool**: A new tool is needed to search cached documents (Issue #115) to improve efficiency.
- **Monorepo Structure**: The project is modular with packages for backend, hooks, workers, and database, using PostToolUse hooks and task dispatchers.
