## Key Insights

- **Database & Task Architecture**: Core systems include observation categorization, task assignment (pending/processing/completed), and worker capability matching.
- **Modular Documentation**: Uses distributed `CLAUDE.md` files for context tracking across components.
- **SSE Integration**: Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE) are critical but have directory mismatch errors in `SSE-Writer`.
- **Priority Handling**: Task queue system supports priority-based processing (e.g., high-priority observations).
- **Next Steps**: Fix `SSE-Writer` directory errors and ensure consistent `CLAUDE.md` generation across modules.
