## Key Insights

- **Observation Linking System**: New `IObservationLinkRepository` interface and `ObservationLinkRecord` type added, supporting 8 relationship types (related, depends_on, blocks, etc.) for tracking observation relationships.
- **Memory Tiering**: Implemented memory tiering with four tiers (core, working, archive, ephemeral) and methods for tier management, access tracking, and consolidation scoring.
- **Importance Scoring**: Added importance scoring functionality with pinned observations and importance boost fields, plus repository methods for managing observation priority.
- **Decision Tracking**: Enhanced decision management with new fields (decision_category, superseded_by) and methods for conflict detection and versioning.
- **Worker Architecture**: Discovered WebSocket-based worker communication, capability-based task assignment, and added WorkerMode type supporting spawn/in-process/hybrid modes.
