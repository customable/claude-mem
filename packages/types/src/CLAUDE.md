## Key Insights

- **Task System Architecture**: The backend creates tasks (observation, summarization, etc.) and assigns them to workers based on capabilities. Task statuses include pending, assigned, processing, completed, and failed.
- **Database Model**: The `database.ts` file defines 18 observation types (bugfix, feature, refactor, etc.) and is central to categorizing work.
- **Endless Mode Bottleneck**: Current synchronous processing causes ~110-second delays; asynchronous processing is needed.
- **Proposed MCP Tool**: A new tool for cached document search is required to improve efficiency.
- **Modular Monorepo**: The project uses separate packages for backend, database, hooks, and workers, with WebSocket-based task dispatching.
