## Key Insights

- **Architecture Expansion**: Significant additions to the repository pattern including project settings, observation templates, and observation links, indicating a move toward more structured data relationships and project-specific configurations.
- **Plugin System**: Introduction of a comprehensive plugin system with lifecycle hooks, suggesting future extensibility and modularity.
- **Memory Sharing**: New memory sharing types and interfaces were added, hinting at upcoming collaboration features.
- **Importance Management**: Enhanced observation importance scoring methods (pinning, boosting) were implemented, improving prioritization capabilities.
- **Consistency Improvements**: Refactoring for naming consistency (e.g., `SDKSessionRecord` → `SdkSessionRecord`) and adherence to TypeScript conventions.
