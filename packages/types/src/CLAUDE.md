## Key Insights

- **Plugin System Architecture**: A comprehensive plugin system was introduced with lifecycle hooks, metadata, and configuration interfaces, enabling extensibility.
- **Repository Pattern Expansion**: Multiple new repositories were added (project settings, observation templates, observation links) following the established repository pattern with Unit of Work support.
- **Observation Enhancements**: New features for observations include importance scoring (pinned/boost), templates for structured data, and relationship links between observations.
- **Worker Architecture**: Discovered WebSocket-based worker communication with capability matching and added WorkerMode types for different processing modes.
- **Project Configuration**: Added project-specific settings management with CRUD operations and repository interfaces.
