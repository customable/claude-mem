## Key Insights

- **Type System Exploration**: Extensive discovery of TypeScript types including WebSocket protocols, repository patterns, and task management interfaces, indicating active architectural understanding.
- **Federation Feature Progress**: Added hub federation types exports and unified WebSocket channel types, showing advancement in Issue #263 implementation.
- **Task Management System**: Discovered and documented user task types with lifecycle states (pending/in_progress/completed) and repository interfaces for database operations.
- **Observation System**: Found ObservationType definitions with 19 work categories and repository patterns supporting BM25 search scoring.
- **Next Steps**: Need to resolve TypeScript errors in backend-service.ts (SSE event types) and verify database migrations for the federation feature.
