## Key Insights

- **Git Operations Safety**: Multiple features (#1824, #1826, #1834, #1815, #1810, #1807) were added to handle Git operations safely by pausing/resuming the SSE-Writer to prevent file conflicts during Git commands.
- **Endless Mode Support**: New tools (`recall_archived` and `archived_stats`) were introduced (#2084) to support Endless Mode functionality, enhancing memory management.
- **MCP Server Architecture**: The MCP server acts as a bridge between Claude and the backend HTTP API (#2066, #329), with added debugging capabilities (#333, #331).
- **Offline Queue Support**: Backend client now supports offline queuing (#346, #345, #343) to handle backend unavailability gracefully.
- **Validation and Error Handling**: Added validation for CLAUDE.md context tags (#1856) and improved error handling in the SSE Writer (#1818, #1812).
