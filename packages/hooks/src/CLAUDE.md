## Key Insights

- **Offline Queue Support Added**: BackendClient now supports offline queuing for POST requests when the backend is unavailable, with automatic sync when connectivity is restored.
- **Enhanced Debugging Capabilities**: Comprehensive debug logging was added across multiple components (MCP server, backend API calls, plugin entry point, and hook execution) to address Issue #252.
- **SSE Writer Component**: The SSE Writer is a standalone Node.js process that listens to backend SSE events and writes CLAUDE.md files to the local filesystem, handling security validation.
- **Hook System Architecture**: The hook system uses a central registry pattern with default handlers for various events, supporting fail-open behavior when the backend is unavailable.
- **MCP Server Configuration**: The MCP server acts as a proxy to a backend HTTP API, supporting both local and remote backend modes with configurable environment variables.
