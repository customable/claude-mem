## Key Insights

- **Worker Architecture**: Implemented comprehensive in-process worker system with lifecycle management, mutex locks, and configurable modes (spawn/in-process/hybrid).
- **Secret Detection**: Added robust secret detection and redaction across user prompts and tool observations using configurable detection modes.
- **Backend Integration**: Enhanced backend auto-start functionality with path detection and process management capabilities.
- **SSE Writer**: Discovered standalone SSE Writer process for CLAUDE.md file management with validation and filesystem operations.
- **Hook System**: Mapped complete hook architecture including session management, tool observation processing, and event handling registry.
