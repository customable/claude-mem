## Key Insights

- **SSE-Writer Improvements**: Added pause/resume functionality during Git operations to prevent file conflicts (Issue #288). Implemented validation for CLAUDE.md context tags.
- **Debugging Enhancements**: Comprehensive debug logging added to backend API calls, plugin entry points, and hook execution for better troubleshooting (Issue #252).
- **Offline Support**: BackendClient now supports offline queuing for POST requests when the backend is unavailable, with automatic sync when connectivity is restored.
- **Git Integration**: New Git command detection and writer control mechanisms to handle file operations safely during version control workflows.
- **Architecture**: Discovered the SSE-Writer's standalone Node.js process architecture and its role in managing CLAUDE.md files via SSE events.
