## Key Insights

- **SSE Writer Component**: Critical for CLAUDE.md generation, handles security validation and real-time updates via SSE events.
- **Hook System**: Well-structured with defined events (session-start, post-tool-use, etc.) and platform-agnostic handlers.
- **Recent Optimization**: Simplified CLAUDE.md writing logic to reduce complexity and improve performance.
- **Documentation Focus**: Multiple discoveries around hooks, SSE, and session handling indicate active documentation efforts.
- **Next Steps**: Investigate task queue bottlenecks, verify database migrations, and consolidate distributed documentation.
