## Key Insights

- **Hook System Architecture**: The project uses an event-driven hook system with handlers for session lifecycle, tool usage, and subagent management. Key events include `session-start`, `user-prompt-submit`, and `post-tool-use`.
- **SSE Writer**: A standalone Node.js process manages CLAUDE.md updates via SSE, with pause/resume functionality for git operations to prevent conflicts.
- **Git Integration**: Added features to detect and handle git commands, pausing file writes during operations like staging to avoid corruption.
- **Endless Mode**: New tools (`recall_archived`, `archived_stats`) support compressed tool output retrieval and compression statistics.
- **Validation**: Enhanced CLAUDE.md handling with tag validation and context preservation outside `<claude-mem-context>` tags.

## Next Steps
- Complete migration of SSE-Writer to WebSocket for unified real-time communication.
- Test the integrated system (browser, worker, SSE-writer) end-to-end.
- Resolve remaining type mismatches in `@claude-mem/types` exports.
