## Key Insights

- **Hook System Architecture**: The hook system is well-structured with handlers for session-start, user-prompt-submit, post-tool-use, and stop events. It integrates with backend services and supports session lifecycle management.
- **Worker Lifecycle Management**: A Worker Lifecycle Manager has been implemented to transition from hook processes to in-process workers, ensuring only one process becomes a worker using a lock mechanism.
- **Subagent Absence**: Despite database fields suggesting potential support, subagent functionality is not implemented in the codebase. This requires further investigation or implementation planning.
- **SSE Writer Component**: A standalone SSE Writer process handles backend SSE events and writes CLAUDE.md files, validating session IDs and project directories.
- **Recent Fixes**: Bug fixes include removing redundant settings loads and adding missing type annotations, improving code maintainability and performance.
