## Key Insights

- **Hook System Architecture**: The project uses a well-defined hook system with events (session-start, user-prompt-submit, etc.) and platform-agnostic handlers. The `hooks` package exports types, a `BackendClient`, and a runner for execution.
- **SSE Writer Role**: The SSE Writer is a critical standalone process that listens to backend SSE events, validates security (session IDs, project names), and writes `CLAUDE.md` files to the filesystem.
- **Recent Refactoring**: The `CLAUDE.md` writing logic was simplified to write files directly to target directories, removing intermediate storage in `pendingWrites`.
- **Directory Mismatch Issue**: Recurring errors in SSE-Writer logs indicate directory mismatches, requiring attention to ensure consistent `CLAUDE.md` generation.
- **Modular Documentation**: The project relies on distributed `CLAUDE.md` files for documentation, integrated with real-time updates via SSE and a task queue system.
