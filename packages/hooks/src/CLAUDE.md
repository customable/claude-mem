## Key Insights

- **Hook System Architecture**: The project uses a well-defined hook system with events (session-start, user-prompt-submit, post-tool-use, stop, session-end) and structured input/output handling.
- **SSE Writer Component**: A standalone Node.js process that listens to backend SSE events and writes CLAUDE.md files, with security measures for session validation.
- **Session Management**: The session-start handler initializes backend sessions and spawns the SSE writer, while the stop handler cleans up resources and triggers session summarization.
- **Performance Bottleneck**: The current Endless Mode implementation has latency issues due to synchronous processing, requiring optimization.
- **Recent Refactoring**: The CLAUDE.md writing logic was simplified to write files immediately upon receiving content, removing previous pending writes logic.
