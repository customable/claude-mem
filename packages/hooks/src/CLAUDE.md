## Key Insights

- **Hook System Architecture**: The hook system is well-structured with a registry for core events (session-start, user-prompt-submit, post-tool-use, stop) and integrates with backend services.
- **Worker Lifecycle Management**: A new Worker Lifecycle Manager was implemented to handle transitions from hook processes to in-process workers, ensuring only one process becomes a worker.
- **Session Management**: Session handling is centralized, with components for context injection, cleanup, and SSE writer management for CLAUDE.md generation.
- **Type Safety Improvements**: Bug fixes included adding missing type annotations and removing redundant settings loads, improving code maintainability.
- **Subagent Implementation**: No subagent functionality exists in the current codebase, despite database fields suggesting potential support. This needs further investigation for multi-agent coordination.
