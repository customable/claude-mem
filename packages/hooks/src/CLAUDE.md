## Key Insights

- **Hook System Architecture**: The project uses a well-defined hook system with events like `session-start`, `user-prompt-submit`, `post-tool-use`, and `session-end`. These hooks handle session management, observation extraction, and backend communication.
- **SSE Writer Role**: The SSE Writer is a standalone Node.js process that listens to backend SSE events and writes `CLAUDE.md` files locally, ensuring security through session ID and project name validation.
- **Refactoring**: Recent changes simplified the `CLAUDE.md` writing logic to write files directly to target directories, improving efficiency.
- **Session Management**: The `session-start` and `stop` handlers manage session initialization, cleanup, and context injection, including PID file management for the SSE writer.
- **Next Steps**: Address synchronous processing in Endless Mode to reduce latency, implement a new MCP tool for cached document search, and refine task management.
