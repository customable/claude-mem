## Key Insights

- **SSE Writer Enhancements**: Significant work on the SSE Writer component to handle git operations safely, including pause/resume functionality and validation logic.
- **Hook System Discovery**: Detailed exploration of the hook system architecture, including types, handlers, and event processing.
- **Backend Integration**: Added offline queue support for backend client operations to handle connectivity issues gracefully.
- **Compression Success**: Bash content compression achieved high token reduction rates (91.2% and 79.7%), indicating effective optimization.
- **Validation Improvements**: Added validation for CLAUDE.md context tags to ensure proper content structure.
