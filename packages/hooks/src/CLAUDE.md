## Key Insights

- **SSE Writer Enhancements**: Multiple features added to handle Git operations safely (pause/resume functionality, command detection, and validation).
- **Hook System**: Extensive discovery of the hook system architecture, including event types, handlers, and post-tool-use processing.
- **Offline Support**: BackendClient now supports offline queuing for POST requests, improving reliability.
- **Endless Mode Tools**: New tools (`recall_archived`, `archived_stats`) added to support compressed data retrieval and statistics.
- **Validation & Security**: Added validation for `claude-mem-context` tags and improved SSE Writer security checks.
