## Key Insights

- **Hook Handlers Registry**: Centralized event-driven architecture discovered with default handlers for session-start, user-prompt-submit, post-tool-use, and other events. Extensible design allows for custom handlers.
- **Subagent Lifecycle Management**: Subagent start/stop handlers track lifecycle events with fail-open behavior to ensure robustness. Backend API integration for event recording.
- **SSE-Writer Process Management**: Session-start handler spawns SSE-Writer processes for CLAUDE.md updates using Node's child_process.spawn. PID file management ensures process control.
- **Git Command Handling**: Added pause/resume functionality for SSE-Writer during Git operations to prevent conflicts. Implemented command detection and control mechanisms.
- **WebSocket Migration**: Ongoing transition from SSE to WebSocket for real-time communication. ChannelManager and WorkerHub extensions support multi-client subscriptions.
