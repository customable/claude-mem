## Key Insights

- **Pre-compact handler implemented**: New `pre-compact` hook handler added to preserve context before automatic compaction, integrating with backend for observation extraction and compaction event recording.
- **Secret detection enhanced**: Comprehensive secret detection and redaction added to both user prompt handlers and post-tool-use handlers, with configurable modes (skip/redact).
- **Worker lifecycle management**: Post-tool-use handler now includes worker transition logic, supporting both in-process and background worker modes.
- **Hook system architecture**: Discovered and documented the centralized hook handlers registry supporting session lifecycle events (start, prompt, tool-use, stop, end).
- **Performance optimization**: Removed redundant settings loading in worker transitions, eliminating unnecessary function calls.
