## Key Insights

- **Hook System Architecture**: The project uses a robust hook system with handlers for session start, stop, user prompts, and post-tool-use events. These hooks manage backend communication, session cleanup, and observation extraction.
- **Session Management**: Sessions are initialized via `/api/hooks/session-init` and cleaned up with PID file management. The system supports context injection from previous sessions.
- **Backend Integration**: Post-tool-use handlers filter and send tool usage data to a backend service, excluding routing/introspection tools to avoid redundant processing.
- **Endless Mode Bottleneck**: Current synchronous processing in Endless Mode causes ~110-second delays, requiring optimization for asynchronous handling.
- **Next Steps**: Prioritize implementing an MCP tool for cached document search and addressing latency issues in Endless Mode by optimizing the compression pipeline.
