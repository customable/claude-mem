## Key Insights

- **Task Management System**: Discovered a comprehensive task handling system with tools (TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TaskList, TaskGet) and associated logic in the post-tool-use handler.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: The project uses a robust hook handlers registry for events like session-start, user-prompt-submit, and post-tool-use, with extensibility for custom handlers.
- **Git Integration**: Added Git command detection and SSE-Writer control to prevent conflicts during git operations, enhancing stability.
- **Subagent Lifecycle**: Implemented fail-open subagent start/stop handlers that communicate with a backend API, ensuring resilience.
- **Observation Extraction**: The post-tool-use handler processes and filters tool usage data for observation extraction, excluding meta-tools and sensitive operations.
