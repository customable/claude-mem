## Key Insights

- **Git Command Handling**: New features added for Git command detection and writer control to prevent conflicts during staging operations.
- **Observation Extraction**: Multiple discoveries and implementations around post-tool-use handlers for observation extraction, indicating a focus on tracking tool usage.
- **Hook Handlers**: Extensive exploration of hook handlers (subagent start/stop, session start, user prompt submission) reveals a robust event-driven architecture.
- **Secret Detection**: User prompt submission handler includes secret detection with configurable handling (skip/redact).
- **Monorepo Structure**: Project uses a monorepo with 8 packages, requiring careful TypeScript checks and modularization efforts.
