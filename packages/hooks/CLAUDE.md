## Key Insights

- **Pre-compact Hook Implementation**: A major feature addition with multiple components: event mapping (#14640, #14635), handler implementation (#14600), and type system updates (#14593). This addresses Issue #73 for context preservation before memory compaction.
- **Event System Architecture**: Discovered the EVENT_MAP translation layer between fork-style and monorepo events (#14634, #14639), crucial for understanding the plugin's compatibility mechanism.
- **Hook Registry Pattern**: The system uses a centralized handler registry (#14604, #14466) with default handlers for core events (session-start, user-prompt-submit, etc.), making it extensible for new features.
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Resolved hook registration path issue (#14435) by switching from settings.json to hooks.json, fixing the ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} expansion problem.
- **Backend Integration**: The pre-compact handler (#14600) integrates with backend services for context preservation, showing the system's distributed architecture.
