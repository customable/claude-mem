## Key Insights

- **SSE Writer Architecture**: The SSE Writer is a critical standalone Node.js process that handles real-time CLAUDE.md updates via Server-Sent Events, with pause/resume functionality for git operations (Issue #288).
- **Hook System**: The hook system is event-driven with a central registry, supporting session lifecycle events and tool usage observation extraction.
- **Git Integration**: New features added to prevent file conflicts during git operations by pausing the SSE Writer during specific commands.
- **Validation**: Added validation for CLAUDE.md content structure, ensuring proper <claude-mem-context> tags are present.
- **Endless Mode**: New tools (recall_archived, archived_stats) added to support Endless Mode functionality with compression statistics.
