## Key Insights

- **SSE Writer Core Functionality**: The SSE Writer is a critical component that manages CLAUDE.md files, handling directory validation, pause/resume states for git operations, and context preservation logic.
- **Git Integration**: Multiple features were added to handle git operations safely, including pause/resume functionality and command detection to prevent file conflicts.
- **Hook System Architecture**: The hook system is event-driven with a registry for handlers, supporting session lifecycle events and tool usage processing.
- **MCP Server Integration**: The Model Context Protocol server bridges Claude and backend APIs, with tools for search, time tracking, and observation extraction.
- **Archived Output Handling**: New tools (`recall_archived`, `archived_stats`) were added to support Endless Mode, addressing token compression and retrieval of archived tool outputs.
