## Key Insights

- **Git Operations Handling**: Multiple features added to handle git operations safely (writer pause/resume, command detection, writerPaused flag) addressing Issue #288.
- **SSE Writer Enhancements**: Significant work on the SSE Writer component for CLAUDE.md management, including pause/resume functionality and validation.
- **Backend Improvements**: Added offline queue support and debug logging to backend client (Issues #252, #253).
- **Hook System**: Comprehensive discovery of the hook system structure, types, and post-tool-use observation handling.
- **Type Safety**: Added typecheck script to package.json and validation for CLAUDE.md context tags.
