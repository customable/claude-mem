## Key Insights

- **Hook System Architecture**: The project uses a well-defined hook system with events (session-start, user-prompt-submit, etc.) and platform-agnostic handlers.
- **SSE Writer Role**: A standalone Node.js process manages real-time CLAUDE.md updates via SSE events, with security validation for session IDs and project names.
- **Simplified Writing Logic**: CLAUDE.md files are now written directly to target directories, removing intermediate storage logic.
- **Database Structure**: Uses MikroORM with tables like `project_claudemd` and `sdk_sessions` for task management.
- **Next Steps**: Investigate SSE-Writer "Directory mismatch" errors and verify task synchronization between components.
