## Key Insights

- **Hook System Architecture**: The project uses an event-driven hook system with handlers for session lifecycle, tool usage, and subagent management. Key components include the registry, types, and specific handlers for events like `session-start` and `subagent-stop`.
- **SSE Writer & CLAUDE.md Management**: The SSE writer handles real-time updates to CLAUDE.md files, preserving user content outside context tags. It includes pause/resume logic for Git operations to prevent conflicts.
- **Tool Integration**: New tools (`recall_archived`, `archived_stats`) were added for Endless Mode, and the system filters meta-tools to avoid circular logging.
- **Dependency Updates**: The `eventsource` dependency was replaced with `ws`, indicating a shift in real-time communication strategy.
- **Validation & Error Handling**: Added validation for `claude-mem-context` tags in CLAUDE.md and fail-open behavior in subagent handlers to ensure robustness.
