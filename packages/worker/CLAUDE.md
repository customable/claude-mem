## Key Insights

- **Worker Hub Package Created**: New `worker-hub` package established with CLI capabilities for distributed deployments, including WebSocket support and comprehensive configuration options.
- **Vector Database Abstraction**: Implemented a provider-agnostic vector database system with registry pattern, supporting multiple providers (Qdrant, None) and enabling future extensibility.
- **Agent Standardization**: Discovered and documented the unified Agent interface and observation types, ensuring consistency across AI providers (Anthropic, Mistral, OpenAI).
- **Task Processing Architecture**: Worker service handles various task types (observation, summarization, embedding) with robust error handling and signal-based graceful shutdown.
- **Performance Considerations**: Worker processes consume ~138MB each, with database containing 5114 tasks (mostly completed), indicating need for optimization in multi-worker scenarios.
