## Key Insights

- **Worker Architecture**: The in-process worker runs within the hook process with key differences from spawned workers (no auto-reconnection, idle timeout, max runtime limit).
- **CLI Integration**: A new CLI entry point (`@claude-mem/worker`) was added with configurable options for backend connection and authentication.
- **Package Configuration**: The worker package.json was refactored to support CLI integration, including a custom npm registry (`https://git.customable.host`).
- **Dependencies**: The worker relies on Anthropic AI SDK, Mistral AI, and Qdrant vector database for distributed AI processing.
- **Next Steps**: Test new features (CLI, offline queue, file logging), verify TypeScript type safety, and push local commits to the remote repository.
