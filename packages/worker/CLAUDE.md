## Key Insights

- **Vector Database Abstraction**: Implemented a provider-agnostic vector database system with Qdrant integration and a no-op provider for environments without vector DBs.
- **Agent & Embedding Providers**: Discovered and documented multiple AI provider implementations (Mistral, OpenAI) with configurable fallback mechanisms.
- **Worker Architecture**: Comprehensive analysis of the worker service architecture, including task processing, capability resolution, and signal handling.
- **Compression System**: Identified a compression mechanism for archived tool outputs (~95% token reduction) supporting "endless mode" operations.
- **Prompt System Enhancement**: Updated observation type categories in system prompts to improve context generation and task handling.
