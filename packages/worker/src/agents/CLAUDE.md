## Key Insights

- **Agent Registry Refactored**: Moved from static to dynamic provider-based system with configurable priority and fallback mechanisms.
- **AbortSignal Support Added**: Enables query cancellation via AbortController API for better user experience.
- **Memory Tiering Implemented**: Added fields (memory_tier, access_count) and SleepAgentService for consolidation logic.
- **Achievement System Expanded**: Added 70+ achievements and optimized analytics queries with improved fallback logic.
- **Worker Architecture Clarified**: Workers use WebSocket connections; no "InProcessWorker" implementation exists.
