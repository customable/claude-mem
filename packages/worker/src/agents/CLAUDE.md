## Key Insights

- **Agent Architecture**: Discovered and analyzed the standardized agent interface and types, including implementations for OpenAI and Mistral.
- **Interface Expansion**: The `ParsedObservation` interface was significantly expanded to support 19 observation types and new fields.
- **Missing Features**: Identified gaps in the achievement system (UI implementation, API endpoints) and incomplete emoji mappings.
- **Next Steps**: Focus on fixing the achievement progress bug, implementing missing API endpoints, and addressing emoji mappings.
