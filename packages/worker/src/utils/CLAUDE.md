| #15350 | 12:52 AM | 🟠 | Added exponential backoff retry utilities | ~3579 |

## Key Insights

- **Caching & Performance**: Implemented LRU caching with TTL, ETag middleware, and invalidation logic for critical endpoints (projects, analytics, stats). Addressed N+1 query issues in `DataRouter.listSessions()`.
- **Observability**: Added tracing, structured logging, and Prometheus metrics. Enhanced worker profiles and search with BM25 ranking.
- **Schema & Architecture**: Identified schema drift and missing repository files in the database package. Documented redesign requirements for issue #197.
- **Next Steps**: Resolve backend port conflicts, test cache invalidation under load, and optimize UI bundle sizes. Prioritize schema redesign (issue #197) and caching (issue #203).
- **Technical Debt**: Fixed TypeScript generic inconsistencies in `CacheManager` and addressed gaps in request tracing/metrics.
