## Key Insights

- **Compression Feature Expansion**: Major focus on implementing compression capabilities across worker services, agents, and handlers (IDs #756, #755, #753, #752, #751, #750, #747, #746, #744). This adds ~95% token reduction for archived tool outputs.
- **Worker Capabilities System**: New capability configuration system added (ID #812) with multiple resolution methods (CLI args, profiles, auto-detection) and enhanced CLI commands (ID #814).
- **Architecture Improvements**: Reordered agent initialization and capability resolution (ID #813) and added conditional Qdrant capabilities (IDs #614, #612) based on vector DB settings.
- **In-Process Worker Analysis**: Multiple discoveries about in-process worker architecture (IDs #754, #621, #611, #457) revealing its blocking nature, timeout behavior, and lifecycle characteristics.
- **System Prompts**: Added compression system prompt (ID #746) alongside existing observation and summarization prompts (ID #745) for consistent output formatting.
