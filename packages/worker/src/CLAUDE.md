## Key Insights

- **Compression Feature Implementation**: Major focus on adding compression capabilities across worker services, in-process workers, and agent detection. This includes new handlers, system prompts, and payload types for archived output compression (~95% token reduction).
- **Architecture Discoveries**: Multiple reviews of worker service architecture, revealing WebSocket-based communication, task processing (observation, summarization, embedding), and in-process worker characteristics (no auto-reconnection, idle timeout).
- **Qdrant Capabilities Fix**: Conditional Qdrant capabilities now only activate when VECTOR_DB is explicitly set to 'qdrant', preventing unnecessary capability exposure.
- **Worker CLI Added**: New CLI entry point for worker package with configurable backend connection options.
- **Dual-Memory Architecture**: Compression handler implementation suggests a dual-memory system for extended context handling through archived tool outputs.
