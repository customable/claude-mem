## Key Insights

- **Modular Architecture**: The project uses a distributed system with worker services, handlers (observation, summarize, CLAUDE.md), and WebSocket connections for real-time processing.
- **Documentation System**: CLAUDE.md files are auto-generated via `claude-md-handler.ts`, using AI agents to summarize activity and insights.
- **Task Processing**: The worker service handles multiple task types (observation, summarize, embedding, etc.) with priority-based queueing.
- **SSE Integration**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) are used for real-time updates, but directory mismatch errors in SSE-Writer logs need resolution.
- **Next Steps**: Fix SSE-Writer directory issues and ensure consistent CLAUDE.md generation across all project directories.
