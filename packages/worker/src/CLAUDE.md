## Key Insights

- **Semantic Search Integration**: New semantic search functionality was added using Qdrant vector database, with handlers for processing search tasks and filtering by project/document type.
- **In-Process Worker**: A new in-process worker implementation was created, running within the hook process with blocking behavior and timeout controls.
- **Qdrant Architecture**: The Qdrant service uses transformers.js for embedding generation (default: Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) and supports both full and incremental sync modes.
- **Worker Service Structure**: The worker process connects via WebSocket, handles multiple task types (observation, summarize, embedding, qdrant-sync), and uses a modular architecture.
- **Next Steps**: Complete Qdrant integration, test worker auto-restart, and refine pre-compact hooks for context preservation.
