## Key Insights

- **In-Process Worker Implementation**: New `InProcessWorker` added with blocking behavior and no auto-reconnection, differing from spawned workers.
- **Agent Registry Refactor**: Dynamic provider-based system replaces static registry, improving flexibility and fallback mechanisms.
- **AbortSignal Support**: Added cancellation support across multiple components (AgentQueryOptions, context generation, ClaudeMdTask).
- **WebSocket Client**: Core communication layer with authentication, reconnection logic, and task routing for worker-backend interaction.
- **Memory Tiering**: New database fields and SleepAgentService implemented for observation consolidation across memory tiers.
