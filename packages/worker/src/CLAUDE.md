## Key Insights

- **Capability Resolution System**: A priority-based capability resolution system was implemented (Issue #265), checking capabilities in order: CLI arguments → environment variables → profiles → auto-detection. This refactors the previous simple fallback approach.
- **Compression Feature**: Comprehensive compression support was added across the system, including handlers, prompts, and task processing for both worker service and in-process workers, aiming for ~95% token reduction.
- **Worker Architecture**: Detailed analysis of both WorkerService (WebSocket-based) and InProcessWorker (blocking, no auto-reconnect) architectures, revealing their distinct lifecycle characteristics and communication patterns.
- **Configuration Enhancements**: New 'profiles' command added to CLI, and worker profiles display integrated into 'config' command for better visibility of worker configurations.
- **Qdrant Capabilities**: Fixed conditional Qdrant capabilities to only activate when vector DB is explicitly set to 'qdrant', preventing unnecessary capability assignments.
