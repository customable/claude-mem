## Key Insights

- **Semantic Search Implementation**: Successfully integrated Qdrant vector database for semantic search, including task handlers, worker capabilities, and fallback mechanisms. The system now supports filtering by project/document type and uses the Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model.
- **Worker Architecture Enhancements**: Added in-process worker implementation with blocking behavior and timeout controls, complementing the existing WebSocket-based distributed worker system with auto-reconnection and task management.
- **Code Quality Improvements**: Refactored text extraction logic in semantic search handlers for better maintainability, and enhanced error handling with fallback to SQLite FTS5 when vector DB is unavailable.
- **System Resilience**: Implemented worker auto-restart with exponential backoff and added vector DB status to API responses for better operational visibility.
- **Modular Design**: The worker package follows a clean modular architecture with clear separation of concerns between agents, handlers, and connection management, supporting multiple AI providers (Mistral, Anthropic) with dynamic registration.
