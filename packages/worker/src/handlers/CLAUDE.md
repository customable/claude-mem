## Key Insights

- **Embedding Provider Abstraction**: Refactored embedding handler to support multiple providers (Mistral, local) via registry pattern, improving flexibility and type safety.
- **Compression System**: Implemented compression handler for archived tool outputs, achieving ~95% token reduction while preserving essential information.
- **Worker Architecture**: Discovered hub-and-spoke architecture with WorkerHub managing WebSocket connections and capabilities-based task routing.
- **Task Priority System**: Proposed and documented a priority-based task processing system for distributed worker management.
- **Database Evaluation**: Research completed on alternative database technologies for scalability improvements.
