## Key Insights

- The project uses a modular monorepo architecture with packages for backend, database, hooks, and workers.
- Key components include observation extraction, session management, and task dispatching via WebSocket.
- The current Endless Mode (v7.1) has latency issues due to synchronous processing, causing ~110-second delays.
- A new MCP tool for cached document search is proposed to address implementation gaps.
- The system supports CLAUDE.md generation, context summarization, and observation handling using AI agents.
