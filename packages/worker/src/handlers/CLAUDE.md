## Key Insights

- **Compression System Progress**: Added core compression functionality (handler, prompts, and exports) targeting ~95% token reduction for archived tool outputs.
- **Dual-Memory Architecture**: Compression handler integrates with existing observation/summarization pipelines for extended memory retention.
- **Worker System Discovery**: Identified central task handlers (observation, summarization, Qdrant sync) and capability-based routing in worker-service.ts.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Implemented real-time updates for Endless Mode with channel subscriptions and reconnection logic.
- **Next Steps**: Test compression workflow, verify conditional Qdrant capabilities, and implement federation routing logic.
