## Key Insights

- **Vector DB Architecture**: Major refactoring to replace direct transformer.js usage with a pluggable embedding provider system, improving modularity and maintainability.
- **Resource Management**: Fixed critical resource leak in `QdrantService.close()` by properly cleaning up the embedding provider.
- **Endless Mode Progress**: Completed UI components (dashboard widgets, settings) and API endpoints for archived outputs, but synchronous implementation causes 110s latency.
- **Code Health**: TypeScript checks pass across all packages, indicating strong type safety, but build warnings suggest CSS and chunk size optimizations needed.
- **Next Priorities**: Address Endless Mode latency through async compression, optimize MikroORM relations, and continue Phase 5 feature optimizations.
