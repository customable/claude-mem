## Key Insights

- Qdrant service uses Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384D embeddings) for semantic search, with SQLite FTS5 fallback
- Worker auto-restart with exponential backoff was implemented but needs production testing
- Pre-compact hooks preserve context before memory compaction
- File tracking in sessions was enhanced, improving state management
- Semantic search integration is partial - full Qdrant integration remains a priority
