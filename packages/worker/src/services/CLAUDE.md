## Key Insights

- **Embedding Provider Abstraction**: Refactored QdrantService to use a pluggable embedding provider system, replacing direct transformer.js usage with a registry pattern for flexibility.
- **Resource Management**: Fixed resource leaks in `QdrantService.close()` by properly cleaning up the embedding provider.
- **Architecture Evolution**: Proposed and documented a unified WebSocket system, worker hub federation, and task priority system for distributed worker management.
- **Scalability Focus**: Identified opportunities for federation and priority-based task processing, with plans to evaluate database options for scalability.
- **Next Steps**: Complete test suite for the new embedding provider system, implement task priority and worker hub federation, and validate worker capability resolution.
