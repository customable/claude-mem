## Key Insights

- **Memory Sharing Feature Added**: A comprehensive memory sharing system was implemented with ShareService, ShareRouter, and related types, enabling collaboration and bundle creation/import.
- **Null Safety Improvements**: Multiple bugfixes addressed null handling in session and observation processing methods, improving runtime stability.
- **Naming Consistency**: Refactored SDKSessionRecord to SdkSessionRecord for consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase.
- **Architecture Understanding**: Extensive discovery of backend service architecture, hook system, session management, and database models.
- **Subagent Absence**: Confirmed no subagent implementation exists despite database fields suggesting potential support.
