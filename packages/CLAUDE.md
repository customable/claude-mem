## Key Insights

- **Worker Architecture**: Workers connect via WebSocket, handle tasks (observation, summarization, etc.), and use AI agents. No "InProcessWorker" implementation exists.
- **Task Management**: Task Dispatcher matches pending tasks to workers based on capabilities, managing the full lifecycle (pending → assigned → completed).
- **WebSocket Protocol**: Backend-worker communication includes authentication, task management (assignment/completion/error), heartbeats, and progress updates.
- **Settings System**: Type-safe, extensible configuration with three priority levels (defaults, settings file, environment variables).
- **Next Steps**: Test Sleep Agent functionality, verify memory tier transitions, and implement conflict detection for analytics.
