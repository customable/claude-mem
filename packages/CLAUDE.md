## Key Insights

- **Memory Sharing Feature Added**: A comprehensive memory sharing system was implemented with ShareService, ShareRouter, and related types, enabling collaboration features with privacy controls.
- **Null Safety Improvements**: Multiple bug fixes addressed null handling in session processing and observation sharing, improving runtime stability.
- **Naming Consistency**: Refactored `SDKSessionRecord` to `SdkSessionRecord` for consistent PascalCase naming throughout the codebase.
- **Subagent Absence Confirmed**: No subagent functionality exists in the codebase despite database fields suggesting potential support.
- **Backend Architecture**: The backend service orchestrates multiple components (sessions, hooks, sharing) with modular route handling and database support.
