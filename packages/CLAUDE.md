## Key Insights

- **Architecture Understanding**: The project uses a modular monorepo structure with packages for backend, hooks, and workers. Key components include the task dispatcher, session management, and observation extraction workflow.
- **Endless Mode Limitations**: The current Endless Mode (v7.1) has latency issues due to synchronous processing, causing significant delays (~110 seconds).
- **Task Prioritization**: Documentation generation (claude-md tasks) has been deprioritized, reflecting a focus on core functionality.
- **Transcript Handling**: References to "transcript" in the hooks package suggest context compression mechanisms, though no explicit compression code was found.
- **Next Steps**: Address Endless Mode latency by implementing asynchronous processing, optimize transcript handling, and explore the proposed MCP tool for cached document search.
