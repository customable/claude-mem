## Key Insights

- **Bun deprecation**: Project is systematically removing Bun support (engine requirements, fallbacks, lock files) in favor of Node.js compatibility
- **Build system**: Dependency management now uses npm exclusively, with marketplace sync scripts handling multi-instance deployments
- **Testing focus**: Recent work emphasizes test coverage (error handling, XML parsing, retries) with Vitest/SWC configuration
- **Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation between backend, worker services, and plugin marketplace integration
- **Next steps**: Complete Bun removal, expand test coverage, and ensure Node.js/npm compatibility across all components
