## Key Insights

- SQLite is now bundled directly into worker-service and mcp-server (removed from externals)
- Build process uses esbuild targeting Node 18 with CommonJS format for both services
- Plugin distribution bundles multiple components including worker-service and mcp-server
- Version management is handled separately in different build processes
- Recent refactoring removed significant unused code (e.g., 39% reduction in capabilities.ts)
