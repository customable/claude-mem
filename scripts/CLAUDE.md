## Key Insights

- Version management is fragmented across `build-plugin.mjs` and `sync-marketplace.cjs`
- GDPR-compliant deletion endpoints were successfully implemented
- Windows terminal popup issues resolved with `windowsHide: true` flag
- Critical issues remain: process/memory leaks (Issue #101) and Docker documentation gaps
- MCP tool enhancements (e.g., `search_documents`) are progressing but need further refinement
