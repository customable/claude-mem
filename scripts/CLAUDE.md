## Key Insights

- SQLite is now bundled directly into worker-service and mcp-server (removed from externals)
- Build system uses esbuild with Node 18 targeting for both services and plugins
- Version management is handled separately in build and marketplace sync scripts
- Recent work focused on project settings storage, observation templates, and worker architecture
- In-process worker implementation was added with file-based mutex locks and lifecycle management
