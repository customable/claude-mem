## Key Insights

- **Playwright Testing**: The project uses Playwright for UI testing, with screenshots generated for desktop, tablet, and mobile views. These artifacts are stored in `.playwright-mcp`.
- **Bun Migration**: Bun is being phased out in favor of Node.js due to compatibility issues. Key areas affected include build scripts, Docker configurations, and plugin hooks.
- **UI Improvements**: Multiple UI issues were documented, with a focus on mobile and desktop views. These are prioritized for future improvements.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The system uses WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates, which should be considered during the Bun-to-Node migration.
- **Next Steps**: Focus on implementing the Bun-to-Node migration and addressing prioritized UI improvements.
