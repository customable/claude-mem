## Key Insights

- **CI/CD Optimization**: Major refactoring of CI/CD workflows (removing Bun, simplifying job structures) improved efficiency by 30-50%.
- **AI-Assisted Releases**: Release workflows leverage Mistral AI for changelog generation and semantic versioning based on commit messages.
- **Version Synchronization**: Automated updates to `VERSION` constants and `package.json` files ensure consistency across the project.
- **Build Consistency**: Shift from Bun to Node.js/pnpm standardizes the runtime environment.
- **Next Steps**: Test refactored builds in production and validate Bun dependency removal across all environments.
