## Key Insights

- **Bun Removal**: CI/CD workflows are being simplified by removing Bun setup steps, standardizing on pnpm for package management.
- **Release Automation**: The release workflow now automatically updates the `VERSION` constant in `constants.ts` and stages all relevant package.json files, ensuring version consistency.
- **Semantic Versioning**: Version bumps are automatically determined based on commit message prefixes (e.g., `feat!` for major, `feat` for minor).
- **AI-Generated Changelogs**: The release process integrates Mistral AI's Devstral for changelog generation, streamlining documentation.
- **Refactoring Progress**: Unused code removal is ongoing, with significant reductions in file sizes (e.g., 39% in `capabilities.ts`).
