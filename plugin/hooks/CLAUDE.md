## Key Insights

- **PreCompact Hook Added**: New hook type (`PreCompact`) introduced to the system, following existing patterns (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, etc.).
- **Hook System Architecture**: The `hooks.json` file defines lifecycle events (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse, Stop) that trigger worker commands.
- **Cleanup Service Implemented**: Added automatic/manual cleanup capabilities, integrated into the backend with SSE events.
- **File Tracking Enhanced**: UI now displays file details, with repository pattern used for data access.
- **Critical Bugs Fixed**: Resolved issues in hook path expansion, CJS compatibility, and null handling in workflows.
