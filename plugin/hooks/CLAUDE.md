| #1111 | 2:30 PM | 🟣 | Changed worker-service execution to Node | ~2495 |

## Key Insights

- Runtime environment shifted from Bun to Node.js for worker-service commands, likely for broader compatibility
- Hooks system uses lifecycle events (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, etc.) for memory management
- Recent focus on MikroORM entity refactoring, embedding provider abstraction, and worker capability systems
- Proposed architectures include WebSocket unification, worker hub federation, and task prioritization
- Database-agnostic design decisions documented, with PostgreSQL compatibility evaluation pending
