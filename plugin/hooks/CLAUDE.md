| #14277 | 10:01 PM | 🔵 | Discovered hook system configuration | ~1487 |

## Key Insights

- Hook system architecture mapped with 4 main lifecycle events (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse, Stop)
- Subagent functionality is documented but not implemented in the codebase despite database fields suggesting potential support
- Session management is centralized in the SessionService class with hook system integration
- Next steps require defining subagent requirements and implementing detection logic in the hook system
- Database schema includes fields that could support subagent functionality if implemented
