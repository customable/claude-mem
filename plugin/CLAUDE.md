## Key Insights

- **Runtime Shift**: The project has moved from Bun to Node.js for worker-service execution, broadening compatibility with older Node.js versions (≥18.0.0).
- **Dependency Mapping**: Core dependencies include `@xenova/transformers` (ML), `@qdrant/js-client-rest` (vector DB), and `eventsource` (SSE).
- **Documentation Spread**: Memory-related docs are scattered across 8 files, indicating a need for consolidation.
- **Hooks Configuration**: Lifecycle hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, etc.) are defined in `hooks.json`, critical for memory system integration.
- **Type System Updates**: Recent work expanded observation interfaces (e.g., `concept`, `gitBranch`) and fixed type inconsistencies.
