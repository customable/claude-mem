## Key Insights

- Project uses modular architecture with multiple packages and CLAUDE.md files per component
- SSE-Writer is a standalone Node.js process managing real-time CLAUDE.md updates via SSE events
- Database uses Mikro-ORM and tracks working directories in observations
- Task system handles distributed processing but needs further integration investigation
- Current focus is on understanding SSE-Writer implementation and task system integration
