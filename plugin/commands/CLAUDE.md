## Key Insights

- **SSE-Writer** is a standalone Node.js process managing real-time CLAUDE.md updates via SSE events
- Project uses modular architecture with Mikro-ORM for database management and distributed task system
- Multiple CLAUDE.md files exist across subdirectories for modular documentation
- Need to investigate why SSE-Writer log was empty in current session
- Task system integration with worker architecture requires further exploration
